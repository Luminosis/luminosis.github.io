What is Science? Science should be this understanding of the World that makes religions have no chance of reappearing. An understanding of the World that encompasses the visible and the invisible, the heavy matter and the subtle matter.

Nature and the entire Universe are subject to strict and immutable Laws. The discovery and understanding of these Laws are essential for humanity. Nature contains everything humanity needs to live, and therefore it is necessary to study and seek to understand it in all its aspects, but it must be done with the understanding that Our Father is the one who engendered it. We must not stop at the visible alone, nor resort to the subterfuge of chance or probabilities. We need a strong and complete science that allows humanity to understand this World, to know how to interact with it, and to find everything it needs to live.

Religions oppose Sciences because they feel that in one way or another, in the short or long term, sciences will prove that Our Father is Love and that they are nothing but lies and scourges of humanity.

The Earth is sick, tired of this humanity that ravages, dirties, and pollutes it. The Earth reacts and will react, and to prevent the worst for this humanity, science, with a spiritual conscience, must work to provide explanations to humanity. Science is essential and can help humanity, but only if this Science is that of studying the Work of Our Father, following in the footsteps of what Epicurus and the ancient materialist philosophers and scientists had accomplished.
