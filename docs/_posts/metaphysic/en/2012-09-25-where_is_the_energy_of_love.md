Where is the energy of Love in this World and in the Universe? Our Father is Love and Christ is the essence of Our Father, but where does it reside? Well, it is everywhere because it is the Void, where the subtle matter is. Everything is Love because Love is the Universe of subtle matter.

Man interacts between physical, visible matter and subtle matter. The source of Love is accessible to him at will and permanently, and it only depends on him and his will to undertake the work that will lead him to access it. The more he encloses himself off in his Ego and in the pettiness of physical matter, the less he will have access to this source. But man can never be "cut off" from this source because he is as much subtle matter as physical matter.

This is how all of Nature is designed, composed of these two matters. Love is everywhere but one must know how to purify oneself, work to access it, and thus become a Son or Daughter of Our Father.
