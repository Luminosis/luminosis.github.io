What is emptiness? Does it exist? What fills all these spaces between the visible and subtle atoms of your Body and the Universe? Epicurus mentions the simultaneity of place and time of emptiness. Emptiness would therefore be one, and what happens in emptiness happens simultaneously in all emptiness. Do you not feel a sense of Infinity and Eternity? What is the purpose of emptiness? Is emptiness Nothingness? Is emptiness an illusion, an image provided by senses that are not adapted to feel and see it? Can one see, touch, feel, taste or listen to emptiness? What sense of visible matter allows us to grasp emptiness? Is Our Father having fun creating something that serves no purpose: emptiness? He did not know what to fill the Universe with or what to put around visible matter so he created emptiness! Think about it.

There is visible matter and subtle matter. There are subtle atoms and in "what" do they move? Where can this force that is Love reside? Does the simultaneity of time and place that Epicurus speaks of have a connection to the unsurpassed speed of simulacra and thought? Think about it.
