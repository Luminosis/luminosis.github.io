What is an atom? An elementary particle, you might say. It itself is composed of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, etc. Well. So you know what Epicurus, Democritus, Leucippus, and the Greek materialist philosophers discovered thousands of years ago! Bravo, you have rediscovered the atom. But what do you know about how the atom functions? Why does it combine with this one and not that one, even though both are of the same kind? Nothing. You look with a magnifying glass, you break atoms to see what happens - what finesse! - and in the end you know nothing about the subtle, transmission, simulacra, time and all that goes with it.

Do you think that Love can be a measurable force? Interesting question, isn't it? Don't we say that Love is a force? Don't we say "the force of Nature"? Ah, but haven't you forgotten something essential in your scholarly, abstruse and twisted models?

How could civilizations that you qualify as prehistoric or ancient achieve things that you yourself with your modern means would be unable to do? And how much have you not yet discovered.

Look at the World. A butterfly will teach you more about galaxies and the universe than this horror of pulverizing atoms by throwing them against each other. It took a deeply sick brain to invent such horror.
