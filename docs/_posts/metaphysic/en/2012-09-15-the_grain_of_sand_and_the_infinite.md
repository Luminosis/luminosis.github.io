A grain of sand in the middle of an endless beach, such is man. Can he understand the Ocean that he hears but never sees or feels? Can man understand the entirety of the Universe? A grain of sand: the symbol of infinity and eternity.
The rock has become sand, a multitude of grains. Each has its place, each has its color, each has its shape, none are identical and all are indispensable. One cannot be removed because they all come from the same rock.

Go to a beach and look at this grain of sand. It was rock, stone and will soon be dust, and only Our Father knows what its matter and energies will become after. For nothing is lost, nothing disappears, everything transforms in the great eternal cycle of Life. So go look at this grain of sand and tell yourself that you are its brother or sister, that you too are a grain of sand of humanity which, itself, is a grain of sand in the Universe.

The infinite is an ocean whose waves you sometimes hear but you can never see or touch. Your place here is to understand this grain of sand.

Philippe
