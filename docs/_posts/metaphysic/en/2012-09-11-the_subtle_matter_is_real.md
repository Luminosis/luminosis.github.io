Love is a force, a feeling, an emotion, a state, an energy, a food, a vibration, etc. Love comes in all states of the world of subtle matter. What instruments do you have to measure Love? Do you know how to measure the radiations of Love? Do you know how to feel Love?

The subtle world of matter possesses a vast richness that surpasses that of apparent matter. Yes, the subtle is matter, this is what the ancient philosophers understood and what still escapes you.

Put yourself in a place that has only known Blood, atrocity, war and feel. Then go to a place that has only known serenity, Peace, Love and feel. What can you conclude from this experience? Yes, you feel, you feel the places... Use the scientific protocol that suits you, take the test populations and verify. Statistically, men and women feel whether a place has known Peace or War. In fact, you yourself experience this regularly. There are places where you feel good and those that oppress you. A simple, everyday experience that makes you touch the world of subtle matter.

Yes, subtle matter is real and has its Laws! There is a science of subtle matter! Our Father is the first scientist of matter, He created it.
