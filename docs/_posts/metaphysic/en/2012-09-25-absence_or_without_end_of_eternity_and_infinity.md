Is infinity and eternity respectively an absence of space and time or rather a space and time without end?
Let's take the hypothesis that space and time are illusions of the physical world, then indeed we can consider infinity and eternity as endless dimensions, but the principle of universal causality then poses a problem. Indeed, if without end there is no object or meaning, it precisely has no end! Nothing can exist that has no meaning, what would Our Father have played with?

If we consider that infinity and eternity are not applicable to the world of physical matter but only to that of subtle matter, then we can relate these two notions to that of Emptiness. We can hypothesize that infinity and eternity are properties, characteristics, of the Emptiness in which subtle matter acts. Thus, due to the absence of movement in the Emptiness, the simultaneity of time and place, then the notions of time and space are not relevant. Infinity and eternity are properties of Emptiness and not of the world of physical matter, this is what Epicurus understood. The simulacra have an unsurpassable speed because they have no speed; they inhabit the emptiness in which the simultaneity of time and place reigns. They are, simply.

To understand this World and the Universe, one must rid oneself of the idea of a necessity for there to be only one conformation, namely that of the visible, of physical matter.
