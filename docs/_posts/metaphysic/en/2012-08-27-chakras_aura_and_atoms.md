Perhaps you have read or heard about the Aura and Chakras? Some practitioners, yogis, etc., talk about them. For some civilizations and cultures, it is a basic understanding of human beings. But do you know how to connect the Aura and Chakras to particle physics? Do you know how to explain the functioning and nature of the Aura and Chakras with atoms and simulacra? No! The ancient Greeks knew it, or at least some Greek philosophers knew it. More than two thousand years later, none of you have been able to "rediscover" this. On the contrary, you have locked yourselves in a marginal and reduced vision of the world of particles and simulacra. You dig your own well of ignorance by persevering on your path of dissecting matter. How can you understand the Universe if you only know a few percent of the particles that compose it?

You laugh at the foolishness of these philosophers with their subtle, hooked atoms, etc. You mock this concept of simulacrum. You call them ignorant while claiming to be a well of knowledge. The truth is that you are the ignorant ones, they knew a thousand times more than you... Reread Epicurus, all of Epicurus. Reread Democritus, Leucippus. "Materialism" or Epicureanism, in your terms, is a philosophy with one of the most complete metaphysics that humanity has ever produced. Give thanks to Michel Onfray for trying to open your eyes with his intelligent analyses of these philosophies, his analyses are worth more than many sermons from religions.
