When two magnets love each other, they attract each other. Magnets, look at this word. There is a polarity like feminine and masculine. A magnet has both. It has two poles. Isn't it strange? Definitely, Nature is full of surprises and shows great consistency in the application of universal principles.

The magnet and its magnetic field, but what is a magnetic field? How to relate it to magnetism that some talk about to heal or find a source with a pendulum? What is the connection? Why does the Earth have a magnetic field? Why does it move? What can this field serve for the Earth because it is not just there to protect certain species from particular radiations? If the Earth has a magnetic field, then does it have a masculine and feminine pole? But what would that serve for?

The magnet is magical, it acts invisibly to the human eye. Eyes do not see, that sense does not work with magnetism. Why?

Many questions still unanswered to this day. Reread the ideas of these amateur physicists and philosophers of Ancient Greece. Yes, those who described the World of matter by putting it back into its context, that of the Universe and a union between Matter - Our Mother - and the Subtle - Our Father. Reread. Reflect, there is more wisdom and knowledge there than what you have painstakingly found in the last 112 years.
