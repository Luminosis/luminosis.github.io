Life. What is Life? Can you define Life? Can you describe what makes Life and its Sister Death? Do you understand that Death is an integral part of Life? What then is this strange thing: Life? Why, when and how does a baby's heart start beating? Why does this seed sprout here and not there? Why this butterfly? Why this bee? Yes, why so much life in Nature?

Why does the Earth move? Why do these mountains grow and these continents come and go? But yes, why does this Nature and this Earth not stop moving, transforming? Why does the sky fill with rain here and there the sun finishes off the last seed? Why? What is the force that animates this Nature and this Earth? The World is strange, don't you think?

Some, undoubtedly crazy, will tell you that Life is there, everywhere, that this World does not contain a single particle that is not animated by Life, this World is alive because it is Life. Yes, Our Father is there and he is watching you...
