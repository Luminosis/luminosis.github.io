Emptiness and atoms. Atoms and emptiness. Do you know how much emptiness and how many atoms are in your body? And why is this atom, yes, this one and not another, next to this one and not another?

"Fantasy!" you will say! Perhaps, but it has been a very long time since men and women laid the foundations of atomic metaphysics. Epicurus, Democritus, Leucippus, and others whose manuscripts you have "lost" found everything without any instruments. How? Because they looked at Nature to understand it. No instrument except sight, the Heart, and Nature.

Emptiness, atoms, simulacra, the concept of time and its consequences, everything is there, was there, right before your eyes. It took you thousands of years to rediscover only a fragment. Your efforts to dissect matter will lead you nowhere, because you have forgotten the essence and the essential: Nature, Love, the Sun, Water, and Our Father. Ten thousand years will not be enough for you to find if you continue on your path. However, the first simple-minded person looking at a flower, a butterfly, and a bee will find it...

Stop your nonsense.

Stop destroying, destroying, and soiling everything.

Stop making horrors.

Look at Nature and you will find everything you need to know.
