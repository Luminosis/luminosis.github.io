What does pragmatism and empirical reasoning bring to humanity? How does humanity proceed to discover the World and progress since its existence? What source does humanity use to seek solutions and move forward? Reflect. What is the first thing that the first man had in front of his eyes? What is there day after day in front of his eyes and allows him to live, to heal, to understand why he is? Yes, Nature.

Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, etc., all these great men have taken as a starting point: Nature. They applied empirical reasoning, pragmatism, and accepted to open their eyes, to not reject anything. They accepted the universality of the principle of causality, thus refuting ignorance and the need to invent chance and fate. They laid many milestones and made great discoveries, but most of them were burned by the Church and religions. Religions, this scourge of humanity, worked to silence this knowledge, discredit it, and destroy it as quickly as possible.

Why this fear? Why this rage and hatred against these philosophers and scientists? Well, because they are the ones who carry a message from Our Father and not the Church and the religions of this World. Reread the book on the Death of Philodemus and you will find the words of Saint Francis of Assisi, you will find the precept that every journey has an end and an object. These men only used their intelligence and reasoning ability by looking at Nature; and they discovered and understood many things about the Will of Our Father, so get out of these temples, these churches, and go into Nature. Use your technological means to go further than these illustrious philosophers, but do as they did, understand that there is no chance, no fate, the principle of causality is universal and it reigns over the Universe forever.
