Eternity and infinity. What do you understand today about these two fundamental elements of the Universe? What is eternity? Can you measure it with an instrument? What is infinity? Can you capture a particle of infinity with an instrument? It is impossible to understand this World, the Universe, and the rest without having properly grasped eternity and infinity.

Look at the ancient philosophers, no instruments but in front of them the most beautiful of laboratories with all teachings at hand. They looked. They asked the beautiful and great questions about this World and the Universe. They found only through reasoning and intelligence much more than you with your instruments to destroy matter. Think, you think you have discovered the atom when Democritus and his friends discovered it several thousand years ago. You think you have found the speed of light as an absolute limit and well reread Epicurus and the speed of simulacra... And you are missing so much about the subtle, the void, time, simulacra, forces, etc.

Gentlemen and Ladies scientists, leave your laboratories. Take off your lab coats and go for a walk. Every flower, every butterfly, every tree, and every thing in Nature has more to teach you than all your books and conferences. Go outside, and there if you know how to use your current means with the wisdom and intelligence of the ancients then you will find...
