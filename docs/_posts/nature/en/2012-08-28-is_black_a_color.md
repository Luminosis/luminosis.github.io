Is black a color? If it were, then it would be part of the Rainbow of Life. The Sun would send out black frequencies with its Light, but it does not. Why?

It does not because black is not a color. Black is the absence of color. Black is what remains when Light disappears or when colors are subtracted from each other. Black is nothingness. Black is harmful to humanity.

The saddest part is the large number of women and men who think that black is the ultimate symbol of elegance when it is the ultimate horror. Those men and women who wear black too often will end up disturbed, their senses will blur, their subtle senses will impoverish, and their existence will eventually sink into the Shadow in one way or another.

If humanity can make a simple gesture to help the World: stop wearing black clothes and even less black underwear! Black is more insidious than drugs, tobacco, and other demonic inventions. Black kills. It kills Nature. It kills the Sun. It pulls you towards it and nothingness. Beware like the plague of people who try to dress you in black.

So my Brothers and Sisters, make this simple gesture, choose all your clothing colors from the Rainbow and throw away these black horrors! Look at this beautiful midnight blue, now that's an elegant color!
