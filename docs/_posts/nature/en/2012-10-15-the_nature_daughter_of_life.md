Nature is the daughter of Life. She is a powerful and immanent expression of Life. The Earth and the planets are part of Nature. The Sun is the guardian and protector of Nature. It nourishes her and ensures, through its cycles, her renewal and growth. Everything is ordered.

Humanity must deal with Nature, not the other way around. Man comes from Nature and is a part of it. He is not a superior intelligence to Nature, for Nature is a creation of Our Father. When humanity attacks Nature, when man's ego makes him believe he can do whatever he wants to Nature, then she prepares what will be necessary for the return to what must be: Nature reigns for the good of men and according to the Will of Our Father.

Human folly, devastation, massacre, and pollution of Nature will have a price that humanity cannot imagine. Wisdom would be to understand all the warning signs and return to Our Father. But how can we believe that greed, the folly of religions, and the power of the scourges created and instituted by humanity can be subdued in such a short time?
