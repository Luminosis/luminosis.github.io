Are you alive? How do you know that you are alive? What indicators do you have? All of this could just as well be a big dream, a huge "matrix" to keep you away from Our Father.

What is it to live? You no longer think about it, but you strive to try to keep Death away! This is a clear sign that you have not understood anything about Life, nor what it means to live. Death is the sister of Life. May Our Father bless Death as Saint Francis of Assisi said. Death is a gift from Nature just like Birth.

To be so afraid of Death, you must have this anxiety of losing what you have not had time to understand: Life.
So sit in a park or a garden and look at Nature. Every element or thing in Nature is born and goes towards its Death. Look. Contemplate. Reflect and open your eyes to Life!
