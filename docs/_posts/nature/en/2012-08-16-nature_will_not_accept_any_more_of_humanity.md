The shadow of the tree brings softness and freshness. The sunlight provides this immense brightness that illuminates Nature. The two go together and form a Beauty of what is in the present moment, both warmth and coolness. Nature knows how to be everything at once. Everyone finds what they need at that moment.

Do you believe that man should go on inventing new species? Do you believe that we should manipulate excessively what has been designed by Our Father? Do you believe that your experiments will always be without consequences?

Nature and its Beauty have patience, but it has its limits, and if humanity does not realize this on its own, then Nature and Beauty will come to remind humanity, with strength and noise, that it is Nature that decides, not humanity.

Humanity has only dirtied, massacred, and destroyed too much. Nature can no longer bear all these foolishness. Our Father is tired of your wanderings and the blood that keeps flowing.

Man, Woman. There is still time. Put an end to what you are doing to Nature. Quickly. Very quickly, otherwise what humanity will suffer will leave an indelible mark on its history.

Philippe
