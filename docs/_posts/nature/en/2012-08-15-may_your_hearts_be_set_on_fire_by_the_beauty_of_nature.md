Like a sunrise, the world must ignite with its own beauty. The sky of your thoughts must become this infinite of colors, let the warmth and softness slowly imbue you, then close your eyes and feel this energy.

Woman. Man. Why the Sun? Why the Earth? Why this perfect distance between the two? Why this attraction that you can measure but not explain? Why do these atoms come together? Modern men, you have not grasped a quarter of what Epicurus understood.

Nature is a miracle, a divine object. You no longer see its beauty. Your eyes are red with hate and blood. Your money turns you into a vile beast. What butterfly would want you? None. Man, Woman, you are no longer part of the beauty of Nature. By your stupidity, you have become an insult to it.

Do you believe that you can dirty, massacre, and destroy a divine object like Nature in this way? Do you really believe that nothing and no one will come to protect it from you? Stop, you still have time. Come back to your Brothers and Sisters who, like you, are Children of the Earth and Our Father. Open your hearts and pray. Pray for this invaluable gift that is Nature and of which you are only a part. A part that, like any species, can disappear...

Philippe
