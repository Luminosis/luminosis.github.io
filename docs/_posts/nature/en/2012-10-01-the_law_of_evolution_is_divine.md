Where does man come from? Evolution is a process of Nature, it is a Law of the Universe and Charles Darwin only used his Intelligence and reasoning abilities by observing Nature. The Law of Evolution does not oppose Our Father in any way because it is He who invented it and implemented it in Nature. Those who oppose the reality of the Law of Evolution based on religious principles have not understood Genesis and/or are being manipulated by religious fanatics.

Nature evolves and will continue to evolve as long as necessary because this evolution follows the very long-term plan of Our Father. It may sometimes take detours due to the foolishness of men but nothing else. Nature has all the necessary resources to resist the foolishness of men, and it will show them the extent of its power. Humanity cannot impose anything significant on Nature because it reigns over the Earth for Our Father.

But where does man come from? Why does he have a Soul? Why can he be a Son or Daughter of Our Father? Where is he going? What is his purpose on this Earth? Man and woman are part of Nature, they cannot be exempt from it. Man arrived through the evolution of Nature at the moment when it was necessary for him to become this mixture of physical and subtle matter. Before, he was only subtle matter, and it was by coming into contact with physical matter that human evolution began. Oh, there were the first men, their matter was raw, animal, and it takes time for the two matters to properly bind.

This World is a gigantic school, a place for learning about matter and its transformation. Remember the Our Father transmitted by Jesus of Nazareth "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven." Earth must become a part of the Kingdom of Our Father, and this is the mission of Humanity.

Humanity must return to its path, it cannot remain distant for very long, especially when it falls into a madness that dirties, pollutes, and ravages Nature. Evolution is a powerful Law and Nature has all the possibilities to bring forth and act according to what is necessary. Humanity should recognize its powerlessness in the face of Nature, that would be wise. No man, nor any of his creations, can resist the Force of Nature.
