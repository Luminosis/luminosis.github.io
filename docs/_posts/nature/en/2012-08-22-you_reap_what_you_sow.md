In gentleness, in Love, in life... wherever you look with eyes full of Light and Love, you will see Our Father. What do you believe this World to be? A dark place infested with criminals? A place that could be the Kingdom of Our Father if only you made the effort?

It is easy to lament about the murders, the weapons, the misery, the famine. It is quite different to reflect on why humanity behaves this way and why it reaps this. Yes! Yes, you reap what you have sown! Exactly and precisely what you have sown and continue to sow, in fact.

What did you hope for? That weapons would bring Peace? That hatred, violence, and money would generate Joy? That disrespecting Nature would give you Love?

You are donkeys with certainly efficient brains. The evidence is not obvious to you, but the slightest horror not to be invented is the subject of all your attention.

You see, you reap exactly what you have sown. Nothing more, nothing less. From stupidity to stupidity, you lead humanity into the abyss of Shadow. Will Our Father have to recreate humanity? The answer is within you and in what you will do... or not!

Philippe
