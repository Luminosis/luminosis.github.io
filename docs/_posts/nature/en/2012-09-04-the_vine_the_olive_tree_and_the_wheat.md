A vine, an olive tree, and wheat. Do you understand what each represents? A vine and the hand of man to make wine. An olive tree and the hand of man to make oil. Wheat and the hand of man to make flour, then oil and water and the hand of man to knead the dough and fire to transform the dough into bread.

If you do not know how to read each of these symbols, you may not know how to read those of your life.
The vine and its grape, fruit of the Earth that the hand of man transforms into wine. What is wine? Go beyond the simple great vintage, what is wine? Reflect, it is an eternal symbol.

Oil, the fruit that becomes oil. There is the material, the texture, and these endless properties and virtues. What is oil? Reflect, it is an eternal symbol.

Bread, the bread that fire bakes. Fire, energy, and transformation. Divine alchemy in the warmth and strength of fire. Bread that nourishes man and woman. Reflect, this is again an eternal symbol.

Can't find it? Reflect again. It is up to you to find and understand. The next time you come across a butterfly, take the time to look at it carefully because it has more to teach you than a hundred professors from the Sorbonne.
