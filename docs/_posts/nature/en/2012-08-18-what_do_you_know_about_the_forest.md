A Forest. What do you know about the Forest? What do you understand about the civilizations of the forest? You haven't even discovered this civilization yet you destroy it savagely. Look at a tree. It breathes, doesn't it? It is rooted in the Earth from which it draws its strength. The wind caresses it. The Sun nourishes it. Could it not be a Child of Our Father?

Every tree you cut down, have you explained to it why humanity needs its flesh? Look at a tree. Sit in front of it and look at it very carefully. What do you see? A trunk? A living being?

Think. Is Nature not an entity made up of living beings, including humanity? And if Nature is alive, well then it can defend itself when it feels attacked. "Madness!" you will say. "What a sick person this guy is!" you will laugh. Go ahead. Do it gentlemen but there will come a day when this Nature will engulf your homes and on that day you will cry for your wives and children as you look at the Sky and you will understand that it is too late... for you.
