Go and look at Nature. Look at it well because tomorrow it will not be the same. Start again tomorrow because it will have changed again, then start again every day because it evolves endlessly. Evolution is the rule of Nature. The Law of Evolution is inscribed in Nature as Our Father created it.

It is enough of this infernal obscurantism of the madmen of religions who want to keep men as far away as possible from Our Father in order to satisfy their thirst for power and money!

The Law of Evolution is divine. Those who doubt it should look at the World and reread the Bible carefully as "He commanded his works for eternity from their origin to their distant generations."

Humanity must respect Nature because it is a treasure given by Our Father. Nature is there to feed man and allow him to discover and understand the Laws of the Universe. It is a priceless gift from Our Father. The madness of this World wanting to dirty, ravage, and massacre Nature will have a price, a lesson of Wisdom will come. Humanity will not understand how such a force is possible and it will have to admit that it is subject to the will of Our Father. The ignorant, the madmen of religions will try to take advantage of it but their disappearance is inevitable as is their future misery.

Wisdom would want humanity to understand by itself, but Our Father knows well that this is impossible today. There will be a day and a tomorrow. There will be the foundation of Our Father's Israel - which has no connection to that country of men or the religion. The will of Our Father will be done.
