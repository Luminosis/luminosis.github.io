Where are you running so fast this morning?<br>

Did you take the time to look at the miracle that opened this day?<br>

Did you say hello to the Sun?<br>

Did you greet Nature?<br>

Did you thank Our Father for this new day?<br>

Did you think about all the Acts of Love you are going to offer to other beings?<br>

Did you tenderly kiss your Children?<br>

Did you know how to caress that animal and say "hello my brother"?<br>

Did you listen to the bird's song?<br>

Did you drink this fresh water?<br>

Did you caress and smell this Rose?<br>

Did you hug that tree?<br>

Did you simply live?<br>

Did you even understand what Life is?<br>

Live! Look at this World and live! Enjoy everything it has so simply wonderful to offer you. Stop running towards a future that only exists in your most harmful thoughts. Stop and look at the World and then the World will give it back to you a hundredfold.
