Of the Beauty that you have before your eyes, what have you drunk and seen?<br>

Wouldn't it be time for you, my Brothers and Sisters, to sit for a moment in front of a sunrise and drink in the Beauty of that dawn?<br>

Have you seen the colors of the sky as it ignites?<br>

Have you listened to the birdsong?<br>

Have you eaten the bread that the Earth provides?<br>

Have you drunk the wine of the Earth?<br>

Have you danced around the fire that warms?<br>

Have you made Love, not just sex but Love with another being?<br>

Do you know in your Heart the feeling of fulfillment that perhaps a true orgasm of Love can bring?<br>

If you haven't, then hurry, take advantage, this World is wonderful. It contains billions upon billions of treasures. It is a gift without value. Do not destroy it with your ineptitude and inability to open your Hearts to the Beauty of the Earth.

Philippe
