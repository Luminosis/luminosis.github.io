Have you listened to the bird singing this morning? Why does this bird sing? What Joy animates it? Why do men and women no longer sing in the morning when they wake up? Why these gray and dark faces of rushed people who forget to live? Do you really believe that making money and taking vacations are the fundamental and essential activities of a life?

Don't you know how to stop and look at this World? Don't you know how to take the time - this precious time that you do not understand - to absorb the Light and Love that is in Nature? What do you want? Why are you here? What are you doing with this precious life? What will you have accomplished on the day when you will have to return to Our Father? Yes! You will all return one day to Our Father and you will have to explain why you have ruined this existence and accomplished nothing.

There is a deep meaning to life. There is a deep meaning to the incarnation of a Soul in matter. There is a meaning... Something in you vibrates and tries to tell you "Listen to it! It speaks the truth. Let yourself be what you must be. Become who you are!". But the infernal noise of the Ego stifles this voice of wisdom. The Ego is what you must get rid of to reach the starting point of your true path. The Ego is a formidable adversary, a friend of darkness and demons that haunt the hearts of men and women.

You have established the Ego as the foundation of those who govern you. You have made sure that those who guide you are the most arrogant of Egos... so this is where it leads you. Change! Change quickly! The clock is ticking, the Sun is burning, and the Earth is getting tired of you...
