Nature has the power to invent what is necessary for the Earth. If the Earth needs predators, then they appear over time. If the Earth needs a new virus to "heal" a species, then it appears. If Our Father asks her to fertilize the fields of men, then she obeys.

Nature is alive. Nature knows what the Earth needs today and tomorrow. Nature works day after day to prepare what will be necessary tomorrow or in a thousand years.

Do you believe that humanity has the right to eliminate a species without further ado? Can you imagine the tremor that this causes in Nature and the Earth? Do you really think that Man is the god of Nature and can subject it to all kinds of outrages? Do you know of a single living being that would not revolt if its Children were massacred before its eyes?

Man, Woman, the anger of Nature rumbles beneath your feet. Do not believe that nothing will happen if you do not change anything, and do it quickly. Humanity is part of Nature and must respect and love it from the depths of its heart, because otherwise misfortune will eventually strike.

Philippe
