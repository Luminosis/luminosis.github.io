A hand. A caress. A kiss. A gaze. A silence. A look. A sublime thought. A magnificent image projected before your eyes. A tree. The wind blowing and making the leaves dance. A river singing from stone to moss along a hill. Have you looked at Nature? What have you seen? Oil, gas, money, blood, pollution, waste, roads, buildings, concrete? What have you seen?
The day when your Children will only know the gray and black of your Hearts passionated about money and eager for consumption, what will you do?

When your world, the one you create day after day, will not be more beautiful than that of a bunch of rats locked in a cage, what will you do?

Have you even thought about it?

What will you do when you have massacred the last species, caught the last fish, burned the last tree, drank the last drop of water?

What do you think has been happening these past days? It's hot by chance. Forests are burning by bad luck. Water is running out everywhere for no reason. The sky is clouding over and the Earth is trembling like that. All this just by chance? Oh, ye of little Faith! Jonah was luckier than you but he was just as stubborn.

Look at the sky. Look at what remains of the Nature that was entrusted to you. Look and weep for what you have done. Dry your tears, roll up your sleeves and get to work, quickly, very quickly! The time has more than come. React now, because otherwise you will understand but then it will be too late.
