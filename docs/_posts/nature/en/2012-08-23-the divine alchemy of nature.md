Come on, men and women of this Earth, open your eyes! Look at this tree and its simple leaves, why do you not understand the divine alchemy that lies within it. Why do your brains prefer to invent new weapons and virtual sources of money instead of discovering the magic of Nature?

Everything is in Nature. Everything is right in front of your blind eyes. Open them! Look! Think about its leaves, this air, this chlorophyll, the Light of the Sun, the Water, the Earth and finally find out how to live without all the horrors that you invent and produce in mass.
