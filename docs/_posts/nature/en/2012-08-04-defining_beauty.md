If we had to define Beauty, we would have a hard time finding the words that could even attempt to do so. Describing it is an illusion. Words cannot convey "the feeling" of Beauty. Because everything is there. "Beauty" is a feeling that originates in the hearts of men and women.

What can we do to define or describe a feeling that is both very personal and universal? Nothing. Nothing and again nothing. We can do nothing! We can only feel and drink in this Beauty in the moment it arises.

Why spend so much time trying to make a feeling felt through a description made of common or sometimes complicated and obscure words, when it is enough to simply feel! Why lose ourselves in battles of beauty experts, some of whom have never even felt it!

Enough! Open your eyes, live, create, taste, eat, dance, play music, listen, Beauty is in the moment of art. Beauty is not in Art. Art is just a way, sometimes, to express Beauty. So all we have to do is open your senses, connect them to our heart and stretch them towards the present moment, what is, there, now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, no, just there, now and which... is no longer. All that remains is the strength of the feeling that envelops your heart in a gentle warmth.
