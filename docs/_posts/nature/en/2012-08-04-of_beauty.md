Beauty is a gateway to Purity, and the Truth of what this Earth and our lives as men and women can be. In the quest for Beauty, there is nothing more delicate than knowing what it is.

There are as many forms of Beauty in this World as there are seeds and grains. And as plants, trees, flowers, and other vegetation only evolve, this Beauty is fleeting. What was Beauty yesterday will not be tomorrow. Beauty is both ephemeral, a halo that dies and is reborn every morning, always different but always a halo and recognizable by all.

Do not try to capture Beauty, let it be. Stop chasing the chimera of an Eternal or permanent Beauty. Nothing like that exists. Youth withers and becomes the Beauty of age and yet youth is reborn elsewhere in its young Beauty...

Beauty is in the present moment, in the instant, that is what gives it its strength, its power, its aroma, and its flavor. If you look at the Beauty of yesterday, it is no longer there. If you look at the Beauty of tomorrow, it is not there. So let us together look at the Beauty of the sunrise, always renewed, never the same, and so Beautiful in this ephemeral moment.

Philippe
