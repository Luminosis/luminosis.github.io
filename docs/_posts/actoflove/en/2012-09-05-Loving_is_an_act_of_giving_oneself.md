Love and Devotion. Love and Altruism. Love is not for oneself, not directly. Love is for others. Love is for humanity and this world. The Love we give, that we generate through our Forgiveness, comes back to us indirectly through ricochets and rebounds. Love generates Love, and it is this second Love that we receive in return.

'Love one another', that says it all. We could perhaps add 'Forgive one another' to explain that Love and Forgiveness are one. Moreover, here is the principle of the feminine and the masculine, the universal polarity. Love and Forgiveness are the two faces of the energy of Christ.

To Love is an act of self-giving. To Love is to forget oneself, to let go of that useless ego and to let one's Spirit go towards one's Soul on the path that leads to Our Father. To Love is to want, it is the strength and courage to want to Love in order to give. Oh, do not believe that Loving is something easy. No, it requires effort, a deep work on oneself, and in fact, that is precisely what Our Father asks of you: to learn to Love and Forgive. Learn to go in Peace and Joy. Yes, learn, by yourself by finally setting out on the path, and by using your Intelligence and your reasoning faculties to seek and understand. Each of your experiences is an opportunity to progress or regress if you do not work. Be careful, each experience is a gift given to you, so do not waste it in vain by falling into the pitfalls of humanity: religions, blood, violence, hatred, intolerance, sex for the sake of sex, etc. Sculpt your Life, make it a work in honor of Love and Our Father.

You can sculpt your Life, but it is up to you to do it because no one else will do it for you. No one will work for you. It is up to you to set out on the path.

Philippe
