The Act of Love is a collection of moments, gestures, caresses, silences, words, looks, Nature giving itself, kisses, and the play of Bodies coming together to get closer to Our Father.

The Act of Love resonates in the Universe. The Act of Love at its deepest resonates with Christ. The Act of Love endures and remains forever in your Heart.

The Act of Love is what every woman and man must discover in the infinity of forms it can take.

The Act of Love. Breathe in a rose and feel what it tells you about the Act of Love. Understand the subtlety, finesse, tenderness, kindness, sweetness, and strength contained in the Act of Love.

The Act of Love contains no violence, no cries, no screams, no "go ahead, destroy me," nothing, none of that! Sex for the sake of sex, in all that it brings to the Shadow, yes, contains all of that. And if humanity is in this state, it is largely because men and women have forgotten what the Act of Love is. "Making Love" today means sex for the sake of sex and is in no way the Act of Love.

Marriage is an invention of religions. Look in your Bible, you will find no mention of marriage. The only sacrament that could be is baptism. That is the only sacrament that every man and woman could receive, and only on the day when they themselves - in full consciousness - request it. A child baptized without understanding what is happening to them is not baptized. They are a Child of Our Father and have all His Love like all of us, but only the woman or man baptized because they have understood who Our Father is, and are determined to fulfill their mission, only that woman or man is a Daughter or Son of Our Father.

Ignore marriage. Be faithful to your Love. Be faithful to Our Father. Love the Children, all of them! Learn the Act of Love, and if your Act of Love lasts a lifetime with your partner, then so be it!

Return to the Act of Love and clean this World of the impurities, filth, and other nuisances with which you have infested it by following the precepts of Religions that, all of them, have nothing to do with Our Father. Religions are the work of humanity and all obey the darkest and most Machiavellian thoughts that can exist.
