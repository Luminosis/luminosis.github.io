Can you explain Love? If you can, then you know how to explain everything that Our Father is! Do not try to explain what no man can explain. Love, the force that gave birth to Light and to this World, cannot be explained by words. Love can be learned, felt, but cannot be explained. Love is not learned in books, there is only one way to learn it and that is to live Life. If you open your senses, all your physical and subtle senses, then you will have the opportunity to feel Love in many of its forms.

There is no "true" Love, "strong" Love, "weak" Love. There is no gradation of Love or "false" Love. There is only Love. If you need to qualify Love, it means you have not yet understood what it is. So go back and experience it because that is the only way to learn it, but be careful not to confuse Love with passion, which is a scourge, not to confuse Love with sex for sex, not to confuse Love with selfishness because you must give to Love and what you receive comes only from the unconditional gift you give.

Experience Love. Create Acts of Love, feel, reflect, meditate and let your Heart open.

Philippe
