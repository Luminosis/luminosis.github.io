Knowing how to Love is an Art, a great and noble Art. Beauty is born from the Art of Loving. What contains the strength of Love or Forgiveness is filled with eternal beauty. You seek beauty when it is only the consequence of Love. Why have so many beautiful works been created by women and men when they were full of Love? Why inspiration today and not yesterday? Do you remember the Muses and that source of pure water? Yes, there is a source of beauty and it is that of Love and Forgiveness.

Violence, hatred, bloodshed, and other scourges of humanity cannot inspire anything beautiful unless they have been transformed by the power of Forgiveness to become Love.

If what you have before your eyes does not inspire Love, in one form or another, then it is not beautiful. It's as simple as that. The self-proclaimed great pontiffs of the religion of the Arts will not taste this Truth, but remember what a religion is whether it touches art or Faith: every religion is a scourge of humanity.
Love exists in an infinite number of forms and in fact beauty is inexhaustible, and humanity can create beautiful works infinitely.

Perhaps a work will provoke more or less Love for this or that man or woman, but he or she will know how to feel this Love. Obviously, to feel this Love, to access this source, one must have cleaned one's Heart, Soul, and Body of all impurities and pollutions, or at least have started the work. Do not hope to see if you have not started to open your eyes...

Yes, there is an education, a path of the Art - of Loving - and it is the one that leads to Our Father. You see everything is connected, and by embarking on this path you will access an infinity of treasures. You will not work in vain. Life may be more beautiful than the most magnificent of your dreams, but for that you must get to work and start the path that leads to Our Father.
