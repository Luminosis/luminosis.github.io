What does the end of the Act of Love mean? Why repudiate? Why divorce? Who are these Children? To all these questions the answer is unique: Love and Forgiveness.

The end of the Act of Love is still and always Love, and if it is not Love then it means you have not performed an Act of Love but committed a human mistake. Sex for the sake of sex and its desire, the plagues will have seized your Heart and you have gone astray. You do not know what Love is... because otherwise you would not have made such mistake!
An Act of Love begins with Love and ends with Love. And if you have made a mistake, then quickly, embrace Forgiveness to transform this mistake into Love!

There is no repudiation or divorce - nor marriage - these are inventions of men and instruments of torture of religions. There is only Love and Forgiveness.

Live the Act of Love and end it in Love: Love for your neighbor, Love for the Children, Love for Peace, Love for Joy and Love for Our Father. And if you or your partner fail in Love, then quickly, enter into Forgiveness to transform the plagues of the Heart into Love.

When the Act of Love ends, it is no longer the Love between the partner and the companion but the unconditional Love for our neighbor that is, because it always is. Reread the Sermon on the Mount of Jesus of Nazareth and you will read that everything is Love. It is a narrow path that leaves room only for Love and Forgiveness. The highways of the plagues of the Heart are for the weak and the ignorant, those who do not want to use their Heart, their Intelligence and Reason to work and become a Son or Daughter of Our Father.

Let your Life be Love, work and reflect so that this World becomes like Our Father because He is Love.

Philippe
