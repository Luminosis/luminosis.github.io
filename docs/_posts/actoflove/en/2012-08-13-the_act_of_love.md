Love.

Do you know what Love is? Have you tasted Love? They say "making Love" but in fact we are only talking about sexuality. So, do you know how to "make Love" with a Beautiful and Great 'L'?

Do you know how to feel the Orgasm of the Act of Love?

Do you know how to draw from the deepest part of you this luminous thing that is Love?

Sex is an element of Love just as a delicious wine is an element of a meal prepared "with Love". But the wine does not make the meal, nor the moment, nor the quality of the guests.
If you want to feel the most intense in human sexuality, you will have to learn Love, otherwise your sensations will be those of a vulgar animal, an orgasm of a microbe, and a pleasure without shape or taste. Nothing, you will have tasted nothing, drunk nothing, or even felt anything.

You there. You claim to be a "sex beast" and you are no more evolved than the first rat you will meet in the street.

The Act of Love between two beings is the most magical and Beautiful thing. The Act of Love is the foundation of the masculine and feminine principle. This act is a sweet beginning of the path that leads to Our Father.

Sexuality is an essential pleasure of Life. Those who criticize it, forbid it, ban it, or tarnish it have not understood the intentions of Our Father. Religions and puritans of all kinds are fools who have forgotten all the messages of Our Father.

But let us understand each other. Sexuality can only exists as part of the Act of Love. Sexuality for the sake of sexuality turns a man or a woman into the lowest and vilest animal that the Earth has ever borne.
Sexuality, yes, in all its forms between a man and a woman, in all the ways that will suit this man and this woman. I insist very heavily on the "and", because the Act of Love is by essence a union of two beings - and only two -, a sharing.

Enjoy, man and woman of this World. Enjoy Love. Learn to love each other, starting with what is essential to every being: a companion.

Our Father did not create women and men to lock themselves in convents or monasteries! Only the madness and stupidity of religions have forced them there. Free yourselves, my brothers and sisters! Love Our Father, he is Love and to truly love him you must love a being on Earth. Have Children. Illuminate your Children with your Faith and they will save this World. That is all Our Father asks of you.

May Our Father bless you all. Love each other. Love each other from morning to night. Love each other.

Everything is there, everything is in Love. It is the seed of this World.

Philippe
