When a child asks their parents if having a little brother or sister soon will change the amount of Love they receive from them, they find themselves at a loss to provide a coherent explanation. *"But no, my dear, we do not share Love, there will be enough for you and your little sister or brother,"* you will respond. *"Yes, but where will you get this Love from?"* the child will ask with reason. The fear of lacking Love is an endless source of jealousy.

If you accepted the fact that the entire Universe is Love, if you accepted that Our Father is Love, if you accepted to understand that Love is infinite, then you could reassure this child, educate them, and prevent the appearance of jealousy in Hearts. *"Don't worry, my Child. You will never lack Love because the Universe is only Love. Everyone can take all the Love they need, all the time and forever. Our Father will give you all the Love you need. Look at the Sun. Will it give you less light and warmth once your little sister or brother is here? No. You see, Love is like the Sun, everyone receives and takes what they need and want, and there is always enough for everyone. And you know what? You will love your little sister or brother and that will create even more Love in the Universe! You see, Love is infinite and you will never lack it, never!"*
