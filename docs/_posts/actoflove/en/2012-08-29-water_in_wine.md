Do you know Pierre Desproges? So you're thinking that this Philippe is the last of the crazies! He's going on about the Our Father, Onfray, Epicureanism, the Bible, and now Desproges!

And why not? Stop thinking only in terms of religion and open yourself to the Philosophy of Life. This philosophy accepts all those who have, even with humor, written beautiful things. Why should humor be banned from serious and important subjects? Yes, this world is in peril because of your foolishness, and if you don't change, it will end badly, but should humor be banned for that? Doesn't humor allow messages to be heard with strength and finesse where long speeches will falter?

So, do you know Pierre Desproges? Have you read or listened to his column "L'Aquaphile"? He tells the story of his budding love for a woman and the sudden end of it. His text is the description of an ongoing Act of Love that ultimately fails. The woman poured water into his glass of Saint-Emilion. The sensuality, the warmth of the moment are suddenly massacred for him. You see, an Act of Love requires total involvement of the man and the woman in Love and respect for each other. Yes, it requires efforts from both to make this moment, this Act, something unforgettable. Had she understood her partner, looked, listened, and felt, she wouldn't have put water in his wine... She wasn't in the Act of Love. So listen to each other, love one another, and respect each other.

Don't put water in the wine, drink it because it is the blood of Love...

Philippe
