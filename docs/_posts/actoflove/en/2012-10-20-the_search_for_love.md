The Body loves to feel Love. It needs it to be as it was designed. The deprivation of Love is the source of many diseases, and the most important deprivation is that which comes from denying the Love of Our Father that is in each of us.

Why do you think women and men spend their lives searching for Love? Why this insatiable need?

There are those who have denied the Love that is within them and seek to fill this void - which they have created themselves - with something external. Unfortunately, nothing external can fill this void. The only solution is to accept the Love that is within them and thus return to Our Father. There are those who only seek to receive without giving, and they will find nothing but failures, nothing that can satisfy them. They run from goal to goal towards the illusion of "this Love" that will fulfill them.

Finally, there are those who no longer seek Love. They have found it within themselves. They have as much as they need and they only want to give. To give Love without expecting anything in return. They bless and are blessed. They receive even more Love in return, to give even more. They are the awakened children of Our Father, those who do His Will and want the Kingdom to finally come on Earth.
