Knowing how to give. Knowing how to Love. Knowing how to give without taking back. Just giving without expecting anything in return except for what Our Father will give you.

The Act of Love is free, it has no other purpose than Love - you have understood that sex is not Love but sex can be part of the Act of Love. The Act of Love has no other intention than Love. It contains only Love and nothing else. Love and Forgiveness because the two are so deeply connected that it is impossible to separate them.

There is no Love without Forgiveness and no Forgiveness without Love. If you think you know one and not the other then you know neither. Something is playing with you...

So *'Love one another'*, *'Love your neighbor as yourself'*, *'Love Our Father as He loves you'* these are divine words. The foundations of the Act of Love were given to you and explained a long time ago, and it is now more than time to live it, to feel it and finally know it! Love and Forgiveness...
