Love. Do you truly know what love is? Have you truly experienced love? People often talk about 'making love,' but in reality, they are merely referring to sexuality. So, do you know how to truly 'make love' with a capital 'L'? Can you feel the Orgasm of the Act of Love? Can you tap into the deep recesses of your being to experience the luminous essence of love?

Sexuality is an element of love, much like a delicious wine is an element of a meal prepared 'with love.' However, the wine alone does not create the meal, nor does it define the moment or determine the quality of the guests. If you truly wish to experience the most profound depths of human sexuality, you must first learn about love. Otherwise, your sensations will be no different from those of a mere animal - an orgasm devoid of meaning and pleasure lacking in shape or taste. You will have tasted nothing, consumed nothing, and felt nothing.

You there, proudly boasting about being a 'sex beast,' you are no more evolved than the first rat you encounter on the street. The Act of Love between two individuals is a magical and beautiful bond. It is the very foundation of the masculine and feminine principles. It is a gentle beginning of the path that leads to Our Father.

Sexuality is an essential pleasure of life. Those who criticize it, prohibit it, banish it, or tarnish it have completely misunderstood the intentions of Our Father. Religions and puritans of all kinds are foolish; they have forgotten the messages that Our Father has tried to convey. However, let us be clear. Sexuality is an integral part of the Act of Love. Engaging in sexuality for the sake of it alone reduces a man or a woman to the lowest and most despicable creature that the Earth has ever borne.

Yes, embrace sexuality in all its forms between a man and a woman, in all the ways that are suitable for them. I emphasize the importance of the 'and' because the Act of Love is inherently a union of two beings - and only two beings - a true sharing.

Enjoy yourselves, men and women of this world. Revel in love. Learn to love one another, starting with what is essential for every being: a companion. Our Father did not create men and women to be confined within convents or monasteries!

Only the madness and stupidity of religions have forced such restrictions upon individuals. Free yourselves, my brothers and sisters! Love Our Father, for true love of Our Father requires loving another being on Earth. Have children. Illuminate your children with your faith, and they will save this world. That is all that Our Father asks of you.

May Our Father bless you all. Love one another. Love one another from morning till night. Love one another. The essence of everything lies in love. It is the seed of this world.
