The Love you feel when you take their hand. The Love you feel when you love them with all your Body. The Love you feel... The opportunities to feel Love are endless, and Life presents them to you every day, but do you even know how to seize them?

Why don't you "take the time" to stop and savor them? Oh yes, because you don't have the time! Actually, you do have the time but you deny it to yourself, and Life plays a little trick on you to tell you that, for example by making the bus leave right in front of you... If you had taken the time, maybe, for once, for an unknown reason, the bus would have left a few minutes late. Who knows what Life has in store for you!

Open your eyes, open your Heart and don't let all the opportunities that Life slides in front of your eyes pass you by.

Philippe
