Forgiveness, never forget that Forgiveness is part of Love. Forgiveness is the alchemist that transforms into Love. Do not think you can experience and understand Love without deeply immersing yourself in the experience of Forgiveness. Many try to understand Love by carefully avoiding Forgiveness. If you have no idea what Forgiveness is, then you have no idea what Love is. Seek to feel, to experience Forgiveness and you will glimpse Love.

Forgiveness is Love. Forgiveness is a major force of Love. How can one reflect on this World, on Life and this humanity if one has never felt Forgiveness?

Forgiveness involves Will, Wisdom, Intelligence, reasoning abilities and the Heart. It calls upon everything you are. It takes strength to forgive, as much as Love may seem easy, Forgiveness seems difficult. If Forgiveness is difficult, then Love is too. What you think of Forgiveness indicates the path and the work towards Love.
