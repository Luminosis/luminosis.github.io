So this Act of Love? Have you tried it? Have you been able to spend sumptuous hours filling yourself with a Love of unreal power without ever taking off your partner's panties or briefs? Have you felt Love and understood that sexuality - which is an undeniable pleasure and necessary for life - is just one facet of Love?

I know a beautiful woman, kind, generous, with a heart that would fill a cathedral. I spent hours just with her in my arms. Just loving each other. Oh, the sexual desire was present, but neither she nor I felt that it had its place at that moment. On the contrary, it would have tarnished that moment, that Act of Love. It will have its place another time. An Act of Love within a great Act of Love. We each left with a memory that makes eternity something tangible. The most beautiful sensuality, the most beautiful Love is built, sculpted together. Each Act of Love is a work for Our Father.

Michel Onfray - definitely with Epicurus, someone I often quote - wrote a very beautiful text on the Sculpture of Self and his remarks and analysis on Solar Love are very interesting. You see in this World there are, and there have been, men and women who use their intelligence to try to understand it. So you too, think, search, study, work. Nothing good will come in this World if everyone does not get to work.
