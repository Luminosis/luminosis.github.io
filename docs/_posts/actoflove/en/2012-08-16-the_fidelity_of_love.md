Absolute fidelity is the only thing you owe to Our Father. The fidelity that everyone owes to their partner is that of Love. There is no other relationship between living beings than that of Love.

Breathe. Feel the air entering your lungs. Why does it allow you to live? Why is this seemingly simple water indescribable in its infinite possibilities and capacities? Reflect. Everything is Love. Love is in everything and everything is in Love.

The Love between two beings has no end, because Love has no end. What has an end is the Act of Love. It, yes, has a beginning and an end. And if it is so, it is so that each being can multiply Acts of Love and thus learn to know Love in all its forms, facets, and the infinite richness it contains.

Marriage was invented by religions as a means of subjugating the faithful. Jesus of Nazareth spoke of water and milk in [a gospel that the Church considers apocryphal](https://www.babelio.com/livres/Bernard-Marie-Le-Cinquieme-evangile/216417), and yet. Milk and water separate at the end of the Act of Love. They merge during the act and that is where the power of the orgasm of the Act of Love lies. It is a complete, indescribable fusion that leads to feeling the Love of the entire Universe.

An Act of Love can last 1 month, 10 years, 50 years, a lifetime. Everything is possible. Nothing is forbidden. Each Woman and Man is free to give the Acts of Love they wish to the other. On the other hand, what is forbidden is sex for the sake of sex, a relationship without Love, the abuse of women by considering them as objects, the refusal to let the Beauty of forms and a face be freely exposed to the Sun. In all this, only the most Machiavellian forces try to turn this World into hell, but they will never succeed. Our Father will rebuild humanity as many times as necessary, and will send that darkness back to where it belongs: into the void that precedes the appearance of this World.

Man. Woman. Love each other. It is the only mission you have and it is surely the most demanding but it is the only one that will save humanity one day...
