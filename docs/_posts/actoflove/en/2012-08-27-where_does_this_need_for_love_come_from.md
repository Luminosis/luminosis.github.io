Why do men and women spend their lives searching for Love? Love is everywhere: love of wine, love of a job well done, love of beautiful things, love of animals, love of flowers, etc. Love.

But where does this need for Love come from?<br>
Who could have made Love universal?<br>
Which human civilization does not have the word Love in its language?<br>
It's strange, isn't it?<br>

Why is humanity so greedy for money, war, blood, destruction, consumption, pollution, yet so concerned about Love?<br>
Why is Love?<br>
Why not just a quick copulation at the right season?<br>
Why?<br>
Strange, isn't it?<br>
Why this force of gravitation?<br>
Why is the Sun here and not elsewhere?<br>
Why do you feel that shiver when that love letter arrives?

Truly, this World is strange...
