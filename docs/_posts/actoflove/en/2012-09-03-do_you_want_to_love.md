To Love. To love. Do you want to Love? Do you want to feel the joy of being loved, to know that someone is thinking of you? Do you want to feel the caress of an angel bringing you a beautiful thought of Love from your partner? Do you want to feel that strength that makes you feel like nothing can happen to you because someone Loves you? Do you want to feel that indescribable peace that takes over your body and soul when those arms embrace you? Do you want to feel the mountains tremble at the sound of your silent moments of Love?

Ah, but no, you prefer war, hatred, and violence on the big screen in high definition! You prefer to watch movies where blood flows freely, where revenge, crime, and killing are glorified. That is your bread and wine for the day. You drink and eat all these horrors continuously. Your children play at killing on screen... You delight in these scenes of violence on your screens. That's it. That's what you are for far too many of you. That's what you sow for yourself and your children...

And one day will come the great fire, the one that will burn all these hideous seeds and fruits so that other men and women can sow Wisdom, Love, Peace, Joy...
