To Know Love is to know that we are Love as Our Father is Love. Man was created in His image and man is Love. Man carries the eternal Love of Our Father within him.

Solitude does not exist, it is only an illusion. In the midst of the most "empty" deserts, man discovers that he is not alone and never will be. The desert, the place where there would be nothing, is filled with Love and Life because every man is Love and Life. Believing in solitude is to distance oneself from Our Father, and it is often in apparent solitude that man discovers the Truth of the Love of Our Father because in this apparent solitude, he shines, pure, not obscured by plagues and egos.

It is in solitude, calm, and discretion of one's room that one can meditate, pray, and feel this Love, then return to one's Brothers and Sisters to give them all this Love, to receive and give even more.

The Joy of giving Love.

The Peace of feeling eternal Love.

The Light of knowing the Truth.

Philippe
