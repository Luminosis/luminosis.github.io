The Act of Love. To Love. To forgive. Yes, to forgive. Do not seek Love if you do not know how to Forgive. You will not find Love until you have understood the endless power of Forgiveness. If Love can move mountains, then Forgiveness makes them fly.

Until you have understood Forgiveness and its necessity, you will not go anywhere, because only it can make your Heart blossom. Life will present you with experiences after experiences until you finally understand Forgiveness. No being can escape the learning of Forgiveness, but many take a long time to surpass this stage. Many do not know how to accept giving themselves the strength and courage to learn Forgiveness. No one is holding them back, only themselves. Forgiveness is the door to Love.

Forgiveness is not just saying "I forgive you for forgetting to buy bread." No, forgiveness is a deep and strong act that calls upon all the strength of the Soul. It is about transforming anger, hatred, fear into Love! Yes, into Love! This is how one discovers and begins to understand Love. Forgiveness is the essence of Heaven.
