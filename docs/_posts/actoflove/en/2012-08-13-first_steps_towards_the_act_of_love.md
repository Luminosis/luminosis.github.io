So man, woman, you want to feel this orgasm of Love. You want to know how to achieve it. The smooth talkers and those who flaunt their breasts, buttocks, and penis wonder if there is something stronger than a miserable ejaculation and a little bit of vaginal fluid?

When one has been eating junk food since childhood, one can indeed doubt the existence of Michelin-starred restaurants. When one has only known seedy motels, one can doubt the existence of Palaces with the most beautiful beds in the world to frolic in.

These gentlemen and ladies of porn will soon have to change professions and move on to the industry of Love. Their profession will no longer exist, or maybe still a little for some animals here and there.

But what is this Act of Love? Ah! You are suddenly very curious!

Think. Open your eyes. Look at your partner and say to them, "Today, my Love, I would like us to have a very long and very strong Act of Love, with just a little bit of sex."

Try it. Think. Meditate. Start the journey, and maybe something will happen...
