Who are these men and women who howl like beasts and roar? What do they understand about Love? Not much more than the first sewer rat. Sex for the sake of sex is not Love, and pleasure is not bestiality.

By delving into the darkest depths of sex for the sake of sex, men and women have lost sight of Love. By confusing sex for the sake of sex with Love, they have paved the way for these religious fanatics. Sexuality is a pleasure of Life, but it is only so if it is a moment within an Act of Love. Sexuality and the pleasures that come from it should be explained to children, men, and women within the Act of Love. Failing to do so, giving it precedence over Love, is to lock humanity into a dark future and an impending catastrophe.

Sex for the sake of sex separates the physical and subtle realms. It insidiously causes spiritual death. Only Love allows the two realms to be united, and thus gently shapes man into what he must ultimately become.

Sexual energy is controllable, usable, and directable like any other force. Willpower, Heart, and Intelligence allow it to be shaped and channeled to become an extraordinary pleasure. A pleasure that goes far beyond the bestial orgasm experienced by the majority of men and women. Sexuality holds treasures, but to enjoy them, it must be a form of expression within the Act of Love.

The Kamasutra is of no use to you at the moment, start by studying and seeking Love. Build Acts of Love and you will see what sexuality between a man and a woman can contain in terms of pleasure.
