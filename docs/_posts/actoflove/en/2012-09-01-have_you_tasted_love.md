Have you tasted Love? Have you tried to touch the full power of Love? Love that nourishes. Love that moves mountains. Love that transforms suffering into Love. Love that purifies impure water. Love that makes you touch the foundation of the entire Universe.

I met it today for several hours. When I think of those men and women who exhaust themselves and degrade themselves in sex for the sake of sex for just a few minutes at most... Understand well, sexuality and sensuality are part of Love but what is not part of it is the animal savagery of sex for sex. When you have tasted the insane pleasure and sensuality of the Act of Love, you will understand how all the efforts that lead to it are nothing.

Look at your partner, what Love have you given them recently? What have you both done that could fill Our Father with happiness, he who is Love.

What nourishment have you given to this World? Screams? Anger? Howls? Braying? Or the delights of a complicit silence of Love between two beings, a power that could bring all the angels around? Love. Work on Love, but not this love-sex, the other one with a capital L, the Love that nourishes, the one that moves mountains. Love, the universal force that holds the entire universe.
