Why do you Love? What do you find in Love? Yes, what is so special about Love that all men and women never cease to seek it?

Take a pen and paper and write down what you are looking for in Love. If it's your happiness, you are mistaken because happiness is already within you. If it's Peace, you are mistaken again because Peace is already within you. If it's Joy, you are mistaken once more because Joy is already within you. If it's the end of loneliness, you are mistaken once again because no man or woman is alone on Earth. If it's sex, then you are completely wrong because sex is not Love.

So what is left?<br>
Strength?<br>
The strength that comes from the gift of Love?<br>
The strength that comes from Love within oneself?<br>
The path of Love that leads to Our Father?

Now, yes, you have an interesting lead, but could it be that it is that little voice within you that whispered these answers to you?
