What do I have against religions? You will tell me that I quote Our Father at every turn, so that is a sign that I am religious, mystical, inevitably! And then you will tell me that all religions claim to be for brotherhood and Love, so why am I so harsh with them?

It's quite simple, religions are a human invention. If religions were a Truth of Our Father then there would be only one and not a drop of blood would have been shed in its name.

Throughout these millennia Our Father has given certain of his Daughters and Sons specific missions to give His Word to humanity. The Word of Our Father is not a religion. The Word of Our Father implies no ritual, no temple or church, no priest, no ecclesiastical order, no monastery, none of that. The Word of Our Father is sufficient in itself because it is everything.

Men with a thirst for power, a thirst for money, unhealthy intentions have concocted religions. They have skillfully used the Word of Our Father, when they have not simply invented everything or so distorted and perverted it that it no longer means anything. Religions are the work of fools. They have caused death, war, hatred, violence, anger, etc., all the scourges of the world. They are insidious and pernicious like the devil of their invention. Moreover, look at how much they talk about hell when all men are children of Our Father, that all are loved and that all will one day be with him!

Our Father is Love, that is the foundation of everything and there is nothing else but Love.

Humanity must rid itself of religions and they will disappear because they are an insult to Our Father. Those who have usurped the Word, those who have deceived men under the supposed cover of Our Father will discover the Truth at the cost of a long journey. It is so, there is always a lesson for the student who needs it.
