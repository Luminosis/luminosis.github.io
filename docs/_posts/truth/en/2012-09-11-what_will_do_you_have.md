Willpower. What do you understand about Willpower and its sister Tenacity? What do you believe you will achieve without any effort or learning to strengthen your Willpower? Do you think that a few prayers are enough for Our Father to do your Will - and not his own?

Why do you believe that your Soul goes through the school of matter? Yes, to work, to learn Willpower and the effort to master, to shape matter. Why would Our Father have created the Universe and matter? This is a big question, why the Universe? What is the purpose of the Universe? Does it have an end, an object? What does matter bring to the subtle and vice versa? Think about it...

If the Soul is perfect and matter is unworthy, then why did Our Father create it? Why unite a perfect Soul in matter if it is impure and imperfect? What sense does that make? A purposeless amusement of Our Father?

Why must matter confront the Soul and vice versa? Think about it. There is a meaning to your Life...
