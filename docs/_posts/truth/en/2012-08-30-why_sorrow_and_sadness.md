Why grief and sadness and not just Joy and Happiness? Yes, why? Our Father has given humanity all the wonders and endless riches of this World, and if you look, you will find neither grief nor sadness. But then where does it come from?

Firstly, there are those who do not know Forgiveness. Those who do not want to accept Forgiveness will have to suffer from grief and sadness until the day their Heart understands that Love and Forgiveness are one. It is man who inflicts sadness and grief upon himself through his ignorance or refusal to open his Heart. If you let Love and Forgiveness guide you, if you let your Tears flow, then sadness and grief will only be fleeting emotions of very short duration.

Then there are those who have lost Faith. Those who no longer believe in anything or worse, who have become fanatics of religions. For them, sadness and grief become the very essence of their being. They are nothing more than that. They suffer from all the torments. Nothing ever goes right or lasts long. It is up to them to open their eyes and return to Our Father in order to start the path towards Peace, Joy, and Love. If they do not understand, well, they will have as much time as necessary until they finally get there.

Grief and sadness are textbooks, and once you have understood what they have to tell you, you no longer need them for the rest of your Life.
