Esoteric entertainers talk a lot about "Light". You are in the Light and so am I, but not him. It's amusing for some. Initiatory pseudosciences talk about breathing techniques, meditation, postures, etc. But before talking about the Light, do you know what the Shadow is? No? It's a shame because you have been immersed in it for centuries.

The Shadow is nothingness. The Shadow wants chaos. The Shadow loves blood, wars, lies, manipulations, dirty tricks to incite hatred. The Shadow delights in all religions that want to convert the "infidels" or massacre them. The Shadow revels in intolerance. The Shadow rejoices in every stoning, murder, whip, etc. The Shadow loves the stupidity of men and women, because it is the men and women of this World who have created the Shadow. Our Father is not to blame, he contemplates the disaster of your nuisances.

You are pitiful in your foolishness when you claim to bring peace by pointing missiles and tanks. You are pathetic when, under the guise of human justice, you kill. You commit a real crime against Our Father every time you use hatred and violence to achieve your goals. The only end you will know for all this is a long path of misery and suffering until your Heart finally awakens.

Humanity is divided in two. There are those who advance, as best they can, but with honesty, on a path that will one day lead them to the Light, and others who hide in the ignorance of their ego.
Who has lied, who has plotted a low blow against others, who has killed, who has carried weapons to kill, who has been violent towards the children and women of the Earth, who has claimed to kill in the name of Our Father, all of them will have a long way to go until they understand for themselves. The punishment is Just and Good. The misery of this World has a meaning. Those who have destroyed, massacred and dirtied must understand.

Now, that doesn't mean they should be overwhelmed. It is not up to men to add another sanction. Misery shows the way to Forgiveness, Mercy, and Compassion. He who helps man in misery to understand and advance towards Our Father, he is a Saint. He who, in passing, gives food thinking he is saving and reducing misery is a good man, but he is ignorant and has not understood. Help the poor and the miserable, but if you want no more misery in this World then change. Change quickly, very quickly, because time is running out.
