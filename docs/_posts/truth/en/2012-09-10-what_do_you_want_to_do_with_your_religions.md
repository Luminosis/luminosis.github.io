What do you want to do with your religions? You know, those hideous and horrible inventions that have served as excuses to shed more blood than there is water in the oceans.

Where does it say that religions were given by Our Father? Nowhere! Get rid of these plagues as soon as possible. Stop listening to these fathers of religions whose only goal is to satisfy their thirst for power, gold, and blood. Run away from them!
Look at what they have done to this world! War, violence, hatred, intolerance, jealousy, all under the hypocrisy of a vile lie that they are love!

Look at them! The first thing they seek to do is to create a sense of difference by introducing rituals, clothing, body mutilations, etc. Don't you understand the purpose, to make men and women of a religion feel different from others. Then exploit this to provoke intolerance, stroke the ego so that it thinks it is better and holds the truth. Abominable. Hideous. Never, Our Father has never wanted such infamies! Stay away from these scourges of humanity and return to Our Father.
Our Father is Love, Love and Forgiveness. How can you believe that a Son or Daughter of Our Father could say or endorse killing, lying, stoning, torturing, insulting, carrying a weapon, making war, etc.? Open your eyes! It is high time!

Protect your children. Take them out of the clutches of these religious fanatics. Faith is the fruit of intelligence and reasoning, not indoctrination by religions.

What do you need Church, Temple, and other for? You have the greatest Holy place: the Earth and its Nature. Pray under the first tree you come across, it is nobler and holier than all cathedrals! What do you need these rituals and instructions for prayer? What do you need these deceitful sermons for? You only need your Heart, your Intelligence, and your ability to reason. Throw away the rest. Listen to your Heart and pray in discretion. Prayer is a personal, strong, and intimate act. No need for a church, temple, priest, pastor, or ritual.

My brothers and sisters, free yourselves from religions, they are the ones who have led this world to its Apocalypse. Return to Our Father with your Heart, Intelligence, and Reason. Let Our Father take care of these religious fanatics. Love, put Love in your Heart and return to Our Father.

Philippe
