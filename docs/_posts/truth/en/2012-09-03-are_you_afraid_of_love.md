Fear. Reflect on Fear. The fear of dying. The fear of illness. The fear of accidents. The fear of tomorrow. Why these fears? What are you afraid of? Do you have something to blame yourself for?

Oh, fear does not only come from a guilty conscience. Fear can also come when facing this leap of Faith. Even Jesus of Nazareth experienced it. Close your eyes and say "Yes" to the will of Our Father and go confidently towards him on his path. Today, there is a great fear deep within many men and women, but this fear does not come from Our Father. This fear was not present in man and woman at their birth. No, something insidiously brought this fear into existence and nourished it.

And if this thing does not succeed, then it resorts to its other favorite weapon: religions. Being nihilist or crazy about religions, that's what these demons aspire to make of the men and women of this World. But beyond this fear, there is Love. This force of unparalleled power. Love annihilates fear. Love opens the path to Faith. Love is Our Father. Our Father is Love.

Does Love scare you?

Philippe
