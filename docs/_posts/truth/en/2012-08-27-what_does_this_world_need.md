What does the World need? <br>
Does it need Wars? <br>
Does it need Blood? <br>
Does it need Pollution? <br>
Does it need a polluted and degraded Nature? <br>
Does it need jealousy, hatred, anger, and violence? <br>
Think about it. <br>
What does this World need? <br>

Look into your Heart. Remove this black layer of hatred, violence, blood, anger, and jealousy in which you have imprisoned it and look. You will see what you are. You will see what this World needs. You will see what you could have if only, yes if only... if you really wanted it.
