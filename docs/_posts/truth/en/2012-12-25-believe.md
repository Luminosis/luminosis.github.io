Who to believe? Who should you believe in? Should you believe in someone? Why wouldn't I also be a fool? Am I not inventing all these words and writings? Could all this be just the ramblings of a sick brain?

Look at this and those you believe in. Look at your lives and this World. What do you see? Is Love there? Is Peace and Joy there? Does Nature tirelessly feed all of humanity? Have the weapons fallen silent?

Reflect and use your Intelligence, that of the Heart, and you will find out for yourself. It is not the messenger that you should believe in, but rather the one who sends you the message, and this one wants no religion, only the Love of his Son.
