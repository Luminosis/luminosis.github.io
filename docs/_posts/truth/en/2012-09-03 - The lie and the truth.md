Lie and Truth. Lie is part of the life of too many men and women in this World. It always starts with a small lie, it seems so insignificant, so harmless, but in fact it is a seed, a seed that, if you nourish it with other lies and actions, will quickly become a baobab of plagues for your Heart.

Look at this seed, once in the ground it will give a magnificent tree that will live for several centuries. Each of your thoughts, each of your actions is a seed that you sow in the field of your Life. And it is from this field that you draw your spiritual, psychic and psychological nourishment. If your field only produces fruits of lies then you will become that. You reap and feed on what you have sown.

That is why the slightest little lie, the slightest thought of anger or hatred can take control of your Life. If you nourish it, if you let it grow then you will have to wait for the day of that great fire, that gigantic incident that will come to burn your field. The ashes will nourish the soil, your tears will wet the earth, and you will only have to sow again but this time being careful...
