What do you deserve? Peace? Joy? Love? All three? Nothing, the void of the Shadow that you feed day after day like a monstrous blaze? What do you hope for? A miracle? Happiness that comes without any effort, that would be so easy...

No! You will only have what you deserve and nothing else.

Look at your hands that are full of blood.<br>
Look at your hearts that are full of hatred, violence, and anger.<br>
Look at your children playing on cold, gray concrete.<br>
Look at your cold, sad, dark, violent cities with few or no trees.<br>
Look at yourselves.<br>
Look at the world and nature.<br>
But what have you done!

What do you need? A planet of concrete, cold, without water, without light, without trees or flowers? Is that what you need? The void and money? Then you will have it. Our Father will do you a favor by destroying this humanity and keeping only his Sheep, his own and only his own, the others will perish and return to him for a long time!

Reread or read the Bible. Read. Remember the *Shepherds of Israel* (Ezekiel). A new Israel will be born. A new David. And this time Our Father will be most vigilant. He no longer trusts you. You will have to prove yourself before joining his Sheep. This is where your foolishness has led you. And do not believe for a moment that this new Israel has anything to do with the country you call Israel. Violence, weapons, hatred, war, blood, none of this can be the Israel of Our Father. None of that!
