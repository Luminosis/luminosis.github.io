Who do you trust? Our Father? This man of whom you know nothing? This donkey passing by? Why do you trust these cheaters who lie to you from morning till night and whose inflated egos have led them to the horror that is your politics?

Men. Men without Faith, without Law, without Honor, without Love, without anything but the endless greed of their Ego. These are your "leaders"... These are the ones leading you straight to your Apocalypse!

You will cry when the day comes. They will be even more scared than you. And since you have not understood what Death is - my Sister whom Our Father blesses - your fears will send you where you must go for a while. And that's fine, so Our Father will also have Peace to rebuild his Earth and his People.

"What a sick guy!", you will scream. "But lock up this madman!", you will shout. "This guy is completely crazy!", you will rage. Say. Do.

Remember this book: The Bible. Yes, you know that old book, The Bible. Oh, it's a story for children. Everything in it is false. It's just inventions of a bunch of crazies of the same kind as this so-called Philippe who lectures us, "What an idiot this guy!".

The Bible. The Bible, an invention, a fairy tale? Certainly the fathers of the Church twisted its neck by adding lots of things that have nothing to do with it, and by removing even more that should be there, but it's there.
Is it a book reserved for clients of your psychiatric hospitals? Is it just a bunch of old nonsense? Think and remember... 3,000 years, and then nothing. Remember: Jesus of Nazareth. Remember: David and Solomon. Nonsense, isn't it?

Those in whom and in what you believe will be your end or your future. It's up to you to choose.

Philippe
