Peace will only come when humanity is willing to accept it. Peace is not the daughter of war, nor of blood, nor of hatred. Those who accept these scourges in their hearts will not know peace and will slow down the world on the path towards Peace and leading it to be a place of Love, Peace, and Joy.

Peace is born from the refusal to let one's heart be consumed by scourges, to reject war, violence, hatred, differences, religions. Yes, religions, this world will only know peace once they have disappeared. They are today one of the greatest dangers and scourges of this world. Our Father does not want religions, he did not create any, they are only inventions of men.

Peace must come. Peace will come when the time comes and once humanity has accepted to make the effort of will and wisdom to return to Our Father.

Peace is not won with a gun. Peace is not won by massacring one's brother or sister. Peace is first won within oneself and then spreads throughout the world. The "peace" that is born from war is like Cain's offering to Our Father and he does not accept it. Only the first Peace, that of the Keart, is an offering to Our Father because it is his Kingdom.
