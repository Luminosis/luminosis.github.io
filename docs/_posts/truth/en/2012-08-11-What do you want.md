In this world, Truth is believed through the artifices of science. Yet an essential element is missing: Faith. What is missing is what gives Life and that no science can explain, because it is not a science but only the will of Our Father that can give this Life.

Search, search and kill each other in the meantime. What will you achieve?

Men and women of this world, that's enough! What will you give to your Children once you have destroyed, massacred and soiled everything? What will remain? What will the eyes of your Children be able to look at? A field of ruins or a field of wheat under the sun?
Men and women, what do you want? Peace, Love and Joy or simply war, suffering, unhappiness and everything that goes with it?

Open your Hearts. There is still time, but hurry! Patience and time are running out. And from your foolishness could arise your own end! Don't forget you are responsible for this World, for this Earth, and for what you do with it for your Children.
None of you will escape their responsibilities.

Philippe
