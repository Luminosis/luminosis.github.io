Love one another. Let yourself be guided by Love. Open your Hearts. Let the energy of Love envelop you. The Act of Love is a great moment in your life. The more you practice it, the more you will understand the meaning of your life, the more you will feel, the better your health will be and your ailments will disappear, the more harmonious your life will become.

Oh, it's not simple! You must work on your fears, your thoughts, and all those emotions that disturb Love. The Ego is a limit to overcome. Yes, it's quite a job. Matter must tame itself to open up to Love and Forgiveness - I repeat it because one does not go without the other.

Do not believe in miracles but in the only right effort, that of the mind that finally wants to give meaning to its life. Believe in the one who, through reasoning, intelligence, and reflection, decides to embark on the journey. Faith does not come from indoctrination, it is the Religions, those horrors, that use this infernal method. Faith, the true one, is the result of a true, rational, pragmatic, earthly, and most logical reasoning. It is essential. Man is free and will always be.

It is therefore by himself, of his own accord, that he must find Faith, and only at this price: a free, thoughtful, and constructed discovery that his Faith will be true.

So work, search, read, reflect, everything is before your eyes and you have powerful brains.

<center><strong>Remember, Religions stem from the stupidity of men, Faith comes from intelligence and reason. Faith has no need for a Religion, especially not!</strong></center>
