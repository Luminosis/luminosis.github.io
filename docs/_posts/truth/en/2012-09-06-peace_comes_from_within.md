It is not enough to lay down weapons to find Peace. No, it is the opposite, one must find Peace within oneself to throw down their weapon on the field. Peace will not come from armistices or political agreements. No, Peace will come from the Hearts of men and women. Peace will come from the gaze of a Child that pierces through the opacity of violence, hatred, intolerance, anger, jealousy to reach the Heart of the one who carries the weapon.

You dream of Peace. You dream of this great silence of Joy over the World. You pray for Our Father to put an end to wars, but he cannot do anything because you alone have sown this. How could he bring Peace to a place where Hearts are so impure and full of plagues. There will only be Peace when each of you has started to do the work on themselves.

Our Father, he can remake this humanity the day he deems the situation untenable. A fateful day. It is up to us men and women to do what we have to do so that not only this day never comes, but above all to give Peace, Joy, and Love to this World.

Philippe
