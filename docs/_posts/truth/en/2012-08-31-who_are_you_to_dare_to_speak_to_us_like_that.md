*"Who are you, Philippe, to dare to speak to us like this? Who are you to dare to blaspheme against religions? Who do you think you are?"*

I am a Son of Our Father. My message comes from him. None of you can do anything against me, Our Father would not accept it. I am here to help you open your Hearts and hope that you will be saved.

*"What a madman!"* you will laugh. *"This guy is sick!"* you will shout. Fine. Say.

On one hand, you do not know what a Son of Our Father is. Every man and woman in this World can become a Son or Daughter of Our Father. Yes, everyone. Reread the gospels, Jesus of Nazareth says it and repeats it. Try to use your Intelligence and reasoning abilities to understand - by yourself - the words of Jesus of Nazareth. You may find out how to become a Son or Daughter of Our Father.

On the other hand, you do not know the work - yes, the work - that I have undertaken and continue to pursue. You have no idea of the sacrifices. You have no idea what it is to be entrusted with such a mission. Can you simply try to imagine a rational, pragmatic process with facts, signs of Jonah and sometimes more? Can you imagine the fear, the worry, the anxiety of wondering what is happening, what is happening to you? Do you have any idea of what my fear might have been to wonder if I was not going crazy? But no, rationally, pragmatically, the facts were there, disturbing, unsettling, and others were joining them... What did Jesus of Nazareth experience until he was 30, the age when he began his mission for Our Father? Do you know? No, the Bible says nothing about it, just a few vague lines at most. Do you believe that Our Father challenged his own Laws and in fact those of Nature for Jesus of Nazareth? No! Jesus was a man born of the carnal Love between a man and a woman. Jesus cried and worked, a lot, immensely to be and become what he was: a Son of Our Father.

Believe me to be crazy, say what you want about me, it's up to you. Our Father knows who I am. I know what I must do for him, and I will do it in Love, Peace, and Joy to try to help this humanity.

Philippe
