What are you afraid of? Of Love? Of spirituality? Of men? Our Father is Love, every being is a child of Our Father and has all His Love. There is no distinction. Fear is the fruit of the Ego and the plagues that seize the hearts of men and women.

Fear has no reality. It does not exist because Our Father did not create it. It is an illusion of the human brain. Do not confuse fear with knowing that one is straying from their path, committing an act against Love and Our Father, the feeling of being in danger, because that is not fear but a feeling to know and understand, and to be able to act in a just and good way.

Fear is the foundation of religions, this absolute scourge of humanity. Religions use and abuse fear. They seek to create it in the hearts of men and then use it to manipulate them. Religions lie about death, about life, they distort everything they can from divine texts and messages, they falsify and invent to achieve their goals. Fear is this shroud that covers the hearts of men, these hands that cover your eyes to blind you.

Man invents his fears, and his path is initially to make them disappear to return to the source of Love. Mastery of thoughts, feelings, and emotions is a foundation. The more they are imbued with the strength of Love and Forgiveness, the less fear will have a place. Intelligence and reasoning ability are assets that man must use to achieve this, and that is why religions begin by attacking these assets because they seek to extinguish and direct these abilities.

My brothers, my sisters, set out on the path, feel Love and sacrifice your fears. Your Ego will mourn the loss of its cherished fears and your Heart will beat with the strength of Love and Truth. Become what you are, a Son or Daughter of Our Father.
