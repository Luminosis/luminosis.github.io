What do you think will happen today? Nothing. The end of the world is not scheduled for today, nor for tomorrow, but what will happen is the protection of Life by Nature. The consequences of the actions, thoughts, feelings, and desires of men will be, because that is how it must be. The Law of Universal Causality reigns.

Humanity has had two thousand twelve years to awaken to the words of my Brother, and all it has done is shed blood and empower religions - whether they be those of one of these gods or that of money.

The Sun must be reborn in the Hearts of men, and this solstice day must also be one of distancing. Starting tomorrow, the Hearts of men must and will resume their path towards Our Father. The religions and their gods of fantasy and madness will disappear as their announced end approaches.

Let there be Light.

Let there be Love.

May humanity become what it is and must be: The Son of Our Father.

Philippe
