What do you want, Man and Woman of this Earth? Why do you not want to believe in Our Father? Is it this fear deep within you that tells you that Believing would reveal all your faults, your foolishness and errors?

Have you not understood what Our Father is? Our Father is Love! Love! Forgiveness is the sublime strength. There is no Love without Forgiveness and no Forgiveness without Love. Forgiveness is the most accomplished form of Love. Forgiveness contains the power that makes the Earth tremble and the Void burst.

How do you think it is possible for humanity to progress and learn if Our Father is not Love, and capable of the greatest Forgiveness.

Look at what you, Man, Woman, have done to his Son Jesus of Nazareth. "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." Reflect on these words. You did not know what you were doing. Our Father still forgave you for this horrible act because he thought that time would bring you to understand the full meaning of these words. But no! You understood nothing. Religions have transformed, perverted, and soiled everything. The resurrection of the flesh as well as reincarnation is an invention and a lie. There is no resurrection because there is no end. There is no reincarnation because Life is a continuous path. Death is simply a passage between this Kingdom and the next, that's all.

Beware of men in black. Beware of those who can accept this color on their skin. Beware of those who offer you black clothing, because often, that is the color of their Spirit and Heart. Banish black from your Hearts and wardrobes. Return to the Light of the rainbow of Life and wear colors that call for Peace, Joy, and Love.

Philippe
