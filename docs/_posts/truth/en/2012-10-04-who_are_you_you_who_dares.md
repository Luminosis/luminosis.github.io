Who are you who dares to kill in the name of Our Father?

Who are you who dares to stone in the name of Our Father?

Who are you who dares to speak hate and anger with words that you say are from Our Father?

Who are you who dares to deny the Body and Nature, claiming that this is what Our Father would want?

Who are you to curse men and women in the name of Our Father?

Who are you to cast anathema in the name of Our Father?

Who are you to separate man from woman like the tares from the wheat under the pretext that the Sons and Daughters of Our Father are not equal?

Who are you who thinks, manufactures, and sells weapons claiming to be a Son or Daughter of Our Father?

Who are you who pollutes, ravages, and massacres Nature?

Who are you, humanity?

Yes, who are you?

<center><strong>Our Father is Love.</strong></center><br>

Do you understand that Our Father is Love and that those who claim to speak in His name and do not act out of Love are not servants of Our Father. Those who have usurped, those who have violated the word of Our Father will have to answer for it and will have misery on their path for a long time.

Love, return to the Love of Our Father and pray for your forgiveness.

Philippe
