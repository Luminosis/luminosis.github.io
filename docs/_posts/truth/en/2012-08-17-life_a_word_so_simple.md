Life, it's a simple word. Life. Life. Such a simple word. Look at it. What can you tell me about Life? Have you understood that Life includes Death and its sister Birth? That if one is good then the other is Just. Did you know that?
What would this world be without seeds and seedlings? What is more complex, perfect, magical than a simple seed. Such a small thing, so insignificant, can become a magnificent and centuries-old Oak. But how did the seed arrive? Why does it sprout in the Earth bathed by the Sun and Water? Your scientific explanations are a description of mechanics at its most elementary level. You have not yet understood or discovered the power of the Earth, the Sun, and the Water.

Humanity needs no other source of energy than what Love contains. Nuclear power, this absurdity without name, which may cost you millions of lives, is one of the most hideous inventions in all of human history. Water, Sun, and Earth. If your brains were truly sharp, you would have understood long ago what the Egyptians were about to discover 5,000 years ago now. Our Father did not want it because the Pharaohs had become dark beings fighting against the Light.

"Nonsense!" you will say. "What a madman!" others will think. Very well, gentlemen. Judge me, as others have judged and have their names in the Bible. Ah, but do you believe what is written in the Bible! It is easy in hindsight to believe and have Faith. So easy. Now are you capable of hearing the Truth when it presents itself to you? Are you capable of offering your ears to the Truth? The day your Bible falls from your hands, the day the Vatican is no more, the day Our Father has had enough of this humanity that does not want to listen to him, then, yes, maybe you will start to Believe. It will be too late for now, but you will still have your whole journey to make amends.

Philippe
