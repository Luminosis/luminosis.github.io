What are your dreams? What do you aspire to for yourself tomorrow, and for your Children the day after tomorrow? Do you hope for a happy and peaceful life for them? Would you finally like to know Peace, Joy, and Love?

Your dreams are no more dreams than your life is a nightmare. What you do thinking you are awake, thoughtful, and full of intelligence makes no more sense than the most absurd dream. You believe you are in reality when you are in the immense illusion of the Egos. A great collective fear, without meaning, without reality, and without a future. The Ego is a dream, an illusion, a fabrication of the brain. To be born is to awaken, to understand that this Ego is of no use and that it is the first lesson of matter. By mastering your thoughts, feelings, and emotions, you will make it disappear quickly and by remaining vigilant, it will not come back.

But what lies behind the Ego? Behind the Ego is who you are, the answer to the fundamental question that the Ego cannot stand: "Who am I?".
