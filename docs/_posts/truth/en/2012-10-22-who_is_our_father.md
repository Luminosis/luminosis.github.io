Who is Our Father? Could he be a monster eager to punish humanity? Could he be a sadist who only enjoys the suffering he imposes on men? Could he be incomplete and confused for having created chaos and not endless order? What madness when you realize that these are descriptions given by religions of Our Father!

Love. Light. In the beginning was the Light and it was born of Love. Pure Love. Love is the truth of Our Father. Anyone who dares to claim that Our Father is anything other than Love is truly blaspheming!

Man, humanity, the Brotherhood of the Sons and Daughters of Our Father, everything is Love. The path of humanity is to recognize and understand what Love is, to accept that man is Love and to rediscover in oneself the Love of Our Father.

But then you will ask me why wars, why blood, why torment ourselves with our future? Well, man is free and the Law of Causality is and reigns. So everything depends on each and every man and what he does. The lesson, the one and only lesson is there. Everything is possible, anything can happen but for that, it must be wanted in one's Heart, in one's Body and in one's actions...
