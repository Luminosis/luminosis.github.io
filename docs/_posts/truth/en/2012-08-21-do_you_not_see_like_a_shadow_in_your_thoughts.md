Who are you to laugh and speak ill of me? Reflect on what you are doing and what prompts you to act this way. Do you not see like a Shadow? Do you not see like a black thing that insidiously slips into your thoughts until it takes control of your Ego and your brain?

Thoughts. Thoughts are powerful energetic vibrations. Christ is the most powerful energetic vibration in the Universe. Nothing equals it and nothing will ever equal it.

Why do you let your thoughts lead you by the nose like a donkey follows a carrot without ever being able to eat it. Because the carrot is at the end of a stick held by... But yes! Who holds the stick with the carrot? Could it be Our Father? The Shadow?

The men and women of this World are free; they are free and responsible for their actions before Our Father. Our Father would never use such a method, because for him, women and men must, by themselves, freely, through their own work on themselves, understand what the Truth is. Only the Shadow plays with the carrot and the stick. The Shadow is afraid of one thing: Love. True Love, not the vile sex for sex that you call "making love" and that feeds it. Love is the weapon against all the nuisances of the Shadow. Nothing resists Love, not even the Shadow.

If you want Love then take back control of your brain. Like the captain of the ship, know how to let the wind and the storm pass that will not take you where you want to go. Every time you let yourself be guided by this continuous flow of thoughts, you will make mistakes. Each mistake will generate a new flow of thoughts and mistakes... that's how you miss your path.

Forgiveness is what allows you to get back on your path. Know how to Forgive. Know how to Love. The two are inseparable. If you do not know how to Forgive then you have absolutely no idea what Love is. To return to Our Father, to regain control of your life and bring hope to humanity, start by immersing yourself in Forgiveness...
