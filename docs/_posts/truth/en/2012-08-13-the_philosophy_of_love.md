Here you are, entangled in wars, words, and the most terrible acts that can be.

Man, Woman, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS WORLD?

This question is posed to you, not to Our Father because He knows what He wants to do with it. It has been 2012 years since He showed you the way by sending His Son Jesus of Nazareth.

What have you done since then? Blood, blood, lies, and more blood. Nothing good, or very little. Your survival still surprises Him. He even let it happen, thinking that, anyway, you were so foolish that you would destroy yourselves; saving Him the trouble of annihilating everything.

<p style="text-align: center;font-weight:bold">
STOP!
<br>
Lay down your weapons!
<br>
Look at the Sky, the Sun, the Earth. Everything is there for you!
</p>

Why did you go and get lost in creating religions! How much bloodshed do you need to finally understand that religions are the work of the most harmful on this Earth?

Get rid of religions, and keep only one thing:

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; color: red; font-size: larger;">The Philosophy of Love</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-weight:bold">There lies the only and unique Truth of Our Father.</p>

Philippe
