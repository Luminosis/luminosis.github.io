Today is the day you celebrate the birth of my Brother Jesus of Nazareth, but why celebrate this day? Why celebrate the coming of a messenger and not the one who sends him? Do you remember the message? Have you reread the gospels, and not just those that the church fathers have modified and tainted to their liking? Do you remember the message?

Men and all civilizations that observed Nature celebrated the winter solstice, the day that marks the return of the Sun, of The Light. Is not the return of the Light the most important thing? Christians do not agree on the date of Christmas Day, and they use the results of an incorrect calculation of the solstice day! This leads to many errors and approximations for what they claim to be a divine day!

Forget these horrors of religions and their rites, festivals, and other nonsense. Look at Nature, because everything is there. Nature is the incorruptible, unalterable gospel, the permanent messenger.
