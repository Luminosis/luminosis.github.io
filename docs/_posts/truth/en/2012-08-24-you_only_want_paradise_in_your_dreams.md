Do you need to believe in beautiful stories? Do you want to live an experience like in one of those fairy tales? Do you believe in beautiful love stories? Do you like watching those movies with happy endings? Do you need to hope for tomorrow when you wake up in the morning? Yes? Yes, you say painfully? Well then, say it loud and clear!

But then why do you do what you do to the World and Nature? Why?

What do you want? A dark, cold, ugly and sad life but with dreams like in Hollywood?

Do you know that Our Father wants a World of Peace, Joy, Love and beauty like the Paradise of Heaven, and not just in your dreams? That's the disagreement. You only want paradise in your dreams, and Our Father wants it on Earth as it is in Heaven, and Now. Of course then humanity cannot achieve it. What to do then? Do you think Our Father will mope around? That he will wait endlessly?

No. He will not wait endlessly. He has been waiting for 2012 years already. So act. Act quickly!
