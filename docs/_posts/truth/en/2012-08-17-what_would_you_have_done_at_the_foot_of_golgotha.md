Man, Woman, what have you understood and retained from these 2012 years? What good or beautiful things have you done? What works of Peace, Joy, or Love have you built for Our Father? Where were you? Do you think that the Earth, the Sun, and Nature are just worthless objects that you can soil as you please?

The Pyramids intrigue you. Imhotep fascinates you. There was a civilization that, at one point, knew how to pay tribute to Our Father. Israel has been lost since the time of Kings David and Solomon. Our Father hoped that the coming of his Son Jesus of Nazareth would be enough to make you hear and understand his Will. But alas, nothing worked. You were given the Son of Our Father, and to show you his Love and mercy he even let you kill him in the most horrible way possible, and you still do not understand!

Man, Woman, what will it take for you to open your eyes? Reflect on the meaning of Life. Why death? Why birth? Why misery? Why happiness, Peace, and Joy for some and not others? You speak of injustice without even beginning to think about what is truly Just and Good.

Open your eyes! These writings are not the result of chance or a mystic lacking inspiration. What would you have done at the foot of Golgotha? What would you have done if you had sat on the Sanhedrin that condemned Jesus of Nazareth to death with a judgment full of lies and false testimonies! You did not see the Tears of Our Father when Jesus was crucified by "your care". Man, Woman, enough. Reflect. But do it quickly because otherwise it is Our Father who will make the decision, and then... you will cry for your sons, your wives, and your brothers and sisters.

Philippe
