Does man really need Our Father? After all, he is free and can do as he pleases! Man is free, that is a Truth. He can act as he wishes but his freedom has a limit which is the Will of Our Father. This Will is expressed notably through the Laws of the Universe and man cannot escape from it.

Man also has something within him, this little voice, we call it intuition, we talk about strokes of genius, inspiration, etc. This little voice, which only asks to be heard, is often stifled by the noise of the Ego. This little voice is divine, and it is within everyone. Thus, man is free but within him something makes him feel whether he is on the right path or not, and it is up to him to listen to this little voice or not.

Man is not the only one who is free. The Earth and Nature are also free. They live and evolve in interactions with humanity. Man cannot dominate or control the Earth and Nature.

The greatest freedom lies in listening to this little voice and having a dialogue with it, because there lies the Will of Our Father.
