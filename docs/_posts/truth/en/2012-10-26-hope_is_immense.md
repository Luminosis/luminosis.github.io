The tyranny of Violence and Ego reigns over this World. There is only freedom and democracy in words because for the rest, it is only the wind of Egos and individualism. This World has no head or direction except by default that of misery. Where do you think these politicians, who are greedy for power, money, honor and infatuated Egos, will lead you? Look at these two thousand twelve years of history and what do you see? Tell me where is the thousand years of Peace and Love on Earth? History gives you the trajectory of this World and it is one of war, destruction and pollution. Religions reign in terror and politicians do not see beyond their Ego.

So what hope? Oh Hope is immense because it is born from the Will of Our Father. Hope is immense because there are millions of Souls in this World who have understood and are advancing on the path of Our Father. The proportion increases day by day and there will come a time when they will subjugate this World. A revolution? No, an evolution after the involution caused by these two thousand twelve years of humanity's wandering.
