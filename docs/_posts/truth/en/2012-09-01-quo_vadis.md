Quo vadis? Who goes there? What are you doing on this Earth? Where are you going? Why? Where do you come from? What are your intentions? Have you understood what will happen to you if you do not fulfill your mission or worse, serve the Shadow of this World?

Yes, before your birth you made a commitment. Before your birth, you had to work and prepare for your journey of study and learning of the matter. Earth is a school. A huge school. A school without classes, just a gigantic playground with only Our Father and his servants as supervisors.

Even your hairs are all counted, say the gospels. Yes, all of them, not one is missing and this day after day. Everything is written down, noted. Once the study journey is over, Death brings you back to Our Father, and there you must answer for your actions! The worse your grades are, the harder, more difficult, and longer your path will be. Does the misery in this World worry you? Well, know that it is simply proportional to human stupidity. Religions, wars, blood, lies, money, hatred, intolerance, anger, etc., these are the causes of misery.

If you want a World with less misery, then start working on yourself, right now.
