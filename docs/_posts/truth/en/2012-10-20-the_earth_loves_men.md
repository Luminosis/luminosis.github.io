Earth Loves Men, and men must Love the Earth. This World will only find balance in the acceptance of the universal principle of Love.

The foolishness of those who, like donkeys, follow the successive carrots that their Ego offers them, has generated a lot of damage. The Earth needs to find balance again and it will do what is necessary because ultimately it is out of Love for humanity, that of tomorrow, that it must act.

What will men understand? Will they see beyond their Egos? Will they finally be able to open their hearts and use their intelligence to act with Love towards the Earth? This will come because man is Love and he will eventually understand.
