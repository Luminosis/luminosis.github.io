Who does this rock belong to? Yes, to whom does it belong? To you? To me? To this country? No, to that nation over there? Do you want to go to war to find out who this rock belongs to?

The dinosaurs trampled on it. Our Mother Earth brought it forth from her fire. And we humans are going to shed blood to know who it belongs to? Are we going to burn Nature, rape women, and commit all the atrocities of hell to know who this rock belongs to?! This rock that in ten thousand years will be dust.
That other rock is on the right side of the imaginary line, of illusion, so we will not kill each other for it. But you, yes you there, you are not of my religion as my priests have told me. You do not follow my rituals, you do not wear clothes like me, you are not like me. So finally this rock is mine and your blood and that of your brothers will flow!

Humanity, this is what you are! An infernal denial of Intelligence, Reason, and Love! The complete opposite of Our Father! Pray! Return to Our Father! Flee from these egocentric bloodthirsty madmen!

Philippe
