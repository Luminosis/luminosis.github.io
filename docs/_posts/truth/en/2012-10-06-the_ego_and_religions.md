Becoming who one is, is the simplest and most difficult thing in this World. What you are is known only by Our Father and you. He knows it, so it is up to you to rediscover it, to hear what your Heart tells you and that your Ego strives to conceal.

The Ego is what must be overcome, it is an illusion, a brain artifice, and this first victory is the lesson of lessons, the one after which everything becomes possible. Many have already written on this subject and recently Eckhart Tolle has done a lot to convey this message.

Religions, on the other hand, have never done anything, quite the contrary because the Ego is essential to their survival. Religions try to create differences between men by all means. The Ego is their preferred instrument and they have been playing with it for millennia with infernal expertise. One chooses to wear it as a costume, the other arbitrarily forbids this, etc., and all declare those who are not their faithful as infidels, pagans, abominations.

One must not deny the good will and Faith of many of their followers, but they are being deceived and manipulated. And that is why religions and those who nourish them will have to answer for a serious sin before Our Father.

Religions bear immense responsibility for the catastrophic state of the World today. They cannot escape it. It was a necessary step for humanity to understand the message that Our Father needs nothing else but the Love of Humanity.
