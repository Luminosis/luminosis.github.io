There is in this World a kind of distrust towards everything related to spirituality - not to be confused with the absurdities that are religions - as if men and women were afraid. But afraid of what? Afraid of discovering that, yes, Our Father is? Afraid of having gone too far in error and now, oh my God since we are there, might as well go all the way? Yes, but do you know what is really at the end of the road? Aren't you afraid that precisely at the end of the road there is only one thing? One and only: an end.

Woman, Man, rise up. Look at the Earth. Look at this World. Look at your Children. What do you want?

Do not waste too much time because it has been 2012 years since Our Father sent you his son Jesus of Nazareth. Reflect, decide and act. But do it quickly because time is running out and Divine patience has its limits.

Remember ancient Egypt. Three thousand years of reign for Our Father, then... disappeared. What do you think happened? Do you believe that a civilization of 3,000 years collapses like this, so quickly, just like that? Do you believe that a civilization can last 3,000 years without having been, at some point, the beloved child of Our Father? You who have never done anything that lasts no more than a few centuries, remember, 3,000 years, then nothing.

Philippe
