What have religions served you for? Look, man and woman, at the last 2012 years of religious history, what do you see? Blood, hatred, greed for power, lies, war, massacres, burnings, stonings, murders, screams, intolerance, anger, fear, etc. That's it! That's your religions, that's all they are! None of them are those of Our Father. None. Our Father would never have imagined such horror, only men were capable of it.

The fathers of religions have manipulated, perverted, and tarnished the words of the messengers of Our Father. Not a single one of these religions escapes the rule of human stupidity in the face of power, money, and the like.
Leave these religions on the side of your path. Ignore them. Move beyond them. Enter the Kingdom of Our Father and into a "post-religious" era. Open your Hearts, finally. Look at life and try to understand it. Admire the Beauty of Nature. Drink in the Light of a dawn and a rising Sun.

Stop this global massacre game in the name of your religions. The demons are rubbing their hands, they are having a great time with your ignorance and stupidity. It is so easy to set everything on fire and bloodshed in the name of a religion, it is a delight for them. And you, in your unimaginable stupidity, drink the words of these religious leaders who serve all the demons. Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

Or find a vast plain and all you fools of religions come there. Woman, man, child, all. Massacre each other until the last one. Let your blood flow freely. Not one will escape. And when your cries are silenced, when the last one has breathed his last, then Our Father will clean up this cemetery of misery of human stupidity. He can take care of his Sheep, his own. You will have done him a great service...

Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

Enough of religions, they lead you with a smile straight to the Apocalypse...

Philippe
