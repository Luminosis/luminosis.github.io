What will you leave to your Children? What memories will they keep of these 2012 years after Jesus of Nazareth? What beautiful, wonderful, and fabulous things have you built for them? Internet and Facebook? What have you done so that they can live in Peace with Joy and Love? What have you done with the Nature heritage that Our Father entrusted to you?

Squandered and massacred, that's what you have done. "Make that preacher shut up!" you will demand. "Shut up, you mystic!" you will scream. What's the point? You know that the Earth is fed up with your nonsense. The climate and everything else show it to you day after day. Famine, poverty, wars, blood, it's all there in front of your eyes 24 hours a day. You yourselves give yourselves no respite. The closer the end approaches, the faster you accelerate towards it!

What words could I use if the facts that are in front of your eyes fail to make you see them? Let those who want to hear, hear, let those who want to see, see. Look at your Children, look at the goods, day after day you build their future and to this day it is sordid. It will lead them to have to do work and effort - that you yourselves avoid - to return to Our Father and correct all your mistakes.
