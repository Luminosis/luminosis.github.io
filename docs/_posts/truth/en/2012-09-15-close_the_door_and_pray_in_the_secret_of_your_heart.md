What do you need these rituals, these places, these priests and religious fanatics for? Have you not read or heard what was told to you 2012 years ago? Have you not read that those who make a big fuss about praying in front of others are often hypocrites? Have you not read that those who cannot fast in the secret of their Heart are often hypocrites? Re-read the Sermon on the Mount by Jesus of Nazareth.

Jesus of Nazareth warned you about the dangers of religions. He fought against them. He fought against the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they put him to death because he disturbed them! This is where religions lead Jesus of Nazareth, Son of Our Father, to a cross! It has been right in front of your eyes for 2012 years, but you have seen nothing and understood nothing, allowing religions to set this world on fire.

Look for the oldest state in Europe and see its horrible history and crimes against humanity and Our Father! One day it will tremble because Our Father is tired of this place of lies, sins, and perjury. And the same will happen to all religions because they are not part of his Will, and never have been!

Anyone who confuses religion with the Will of Our Father must abandon religions and return to Our Father. They must withdraw into the discretion of their room, close the door, and pray in the secret of their Heart.
