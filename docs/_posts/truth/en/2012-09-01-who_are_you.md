Who are you? Take a mirror and look at yourself. Who are you? Do you know yourself? Do you really think you are that first name attached to that last name? Do you really think you are one of those societal images that you portray depending on the place, the people or the context? Charming in the nightclub, tough and dry at work, and violent at home...

Who are you? You don't really have an idea. What you are is buried under the debris and filth of your current life. To become who you are, you will have to clean up, not just once, but regularly! Yes, like everywhere, if you don't clean regularly, the dirt comes back. "You" must start your journey and clean, sacrifice, burn everything that is dead, sterile, dirty, useless, and harmful. It's a huge job, but it's only at this price that you will save yourself, and this World with you.

Oh! You will complain, and ask in your prayers for Our Father to do all this for you. He will not do it. You should know that just by looking at the state of this World. You are all free. It's up to you to do or to suffer the consequences. Our Father will just present you with the bill when the time comes, and the more humanity continues on this path, the harder and more difficult it will become. You are free, free to do nothing and suffer, free to work and then taste Peace, Joy, and Love.

Philippe
