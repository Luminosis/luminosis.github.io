Love one another. Thou shalt not kill. Is it so difficult for humanity to remember such a simple precept? Is it so hard to desire Peace, Love, and Joy instead of hatred, war, and bloodshed? Is it so difficult to put your Intelligence and reasoning faculties at the service of Our Father and humanity, his Son, and not at the service of weapons dealers, religious fanatics, and the Shadow?

Oh, this is not a pious wish, a joke from a mystic or any other projection with which you may want to label me to avoid having to think. Flee if you wish, but sooner or later it will catch up with you. Your Heart and Soul will find a way, be it through illness or something else.

To be Free is to do what you want but fully accepting the consequences. The Law of Causality is Universal, divine, and what happens to you at every moment is governed by this Law.

Look at your Children and think about what you want for them and for yourself.

You will say that it is always the fault of others. You cannot help but kill because the other kills. You cannot help but have weapons because the other has a gun. You cannot help but make war because the other... But do you not see the madness in your words? Your Ego or the religious fanatics must have taken hold of you to have lost sight of Our Father to such an extent. Do you believe that the flower must make war on the other flower? Must the thrush make war on the robin to eat every day? Do not worry, simply come to Our Father, open your Hearts, and do His Will and not that of your Ego.

Only the Will of Our Father will be, the rest will disappear.

Philippe
