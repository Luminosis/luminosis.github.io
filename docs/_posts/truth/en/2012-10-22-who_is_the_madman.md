Who is the fool?<br>
Is the fool the one holding the pen and learning, or the one reading and mocking?<br>
Is the fool the one trying to understand thousands of years of history, the texts left by thousands of men, or the one who can't even remember his last "tweet"?<br>
Is the fool the one looking at Nature, the birds, the trees, the oceans, the mountains, etc., or the one burning, massacring, and polluting?<br>
Is the fool the one speaking from the Heart, or the one constantly lying and manipulating to get what he wants?<br>
Is the fool the one waking up before the sun to meditate and pray, or the one vomiting alcohol at the same hour?<br>
Is the fool the one who has complete trust in humanity and wants Peace, Joy, and Love for the children, or the one who only trusts his ego and wants more money in his bank account?<br>

Yes, who is the fool?
