Where are you going on your path? Do you know when you wake up in the morning where you are going? Do you understand what this day will bring you and how it will help you move forward on your path? Do you have an understanding of your life other than time passing before your eyes, aging, children growing up, or a tremendous anxiety that grows, grows, day after day as Death approaches?

Can one look Death in the face without having understood what Life is? Can one arrive serenely at the threshold of Death without having understood the meaning of Life?

What have you run without living, and lived without ever truly living. The emptiness of a life reduced to a Brownian motion around consumption, money, war, violence, hatred, holidays, etc. Sex here and there, a little wine and alcohol, and these are the pleasures you will remember at the threshold of Death? A "hookup" in the elevator as the best memory of your short existence in this World? What a wonder!

If you feel stupid, it's perfectly normal. If you feel that roaring anxiety within you, it's normal. Something in you knows that you have "missed" an important element. You are missing what gives meaning to your life. Something that will make your life not just a small dash between two dates on a tombstone. Yes, a small dash, just a few centimeters at most, that is the memory you will quickly have left on Earth.

So think. Why do you wake up in the morning? Where are you going and why? Why this life? What is the purpose? What are you doing here? Think about Love and Forgiveness, about Our Father, open your eyes and your Heart.
