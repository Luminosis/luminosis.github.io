*"Eat my body, drink my blood"*. What do you understand from what Jesus of Nazareth said? Have you understood what the Body of Christ is? Have you understood what the Blood of Christ is? Have you even understood the difference between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ and why they merged? No? Well, work and reflect.

The Bread is the Word of Our Father. If you eat the Word of Our Father, if you let it spread throughout your whole Body, then you will become one of his Sons or Daughters.

If you drink the Blood of Christ, if you drink what is Holy, what is Divine, then you will become one of his Sons or Daughters.

Ah, but what is the Blood of Christ? You are very curious! The answer has been in front of your eyes for 2012 years and you still have not seen it!

Open your eyes! Open your Hearts! Then you will understand what the Blood of Christ is. Christ is "what is and has always been". Christ is the essence of Our Father. That's it for today... only those who have understood will be able to understand the rest. If you can't do it, do not get discouraged and undertake a great work of cleaning up your Life to get back on your path. This path that you promised to follow when coming to Earth.

Philippe
