There is only One nation, One people, that of Our Father. It takes the madness of the Ego to draw fixed lines on a Earth in perpetual movement. It takes the madness of religions to cry out for conquest or liberation of what never belongs to anyone else but Our Father.

Your madness encourages differences, exacerbates them to try to sow discord among men. In this horrible and bloody game, the madmen of religions have become masters. All men and women are equal, identical, they are all children of Our Father. What father or mother would sow hatred, anger and blood between their children, especially on the pretext that one has blue eyes and the other brown? Only the Ego out of fear is capable of wanting to sow trouble by differentiating the rose from the poppy because one is a flower and the other would be to kill.

Learn to see yourselves as all children of Our Father. Learn to look at each other with the love of a Brother or a Sister because we are only One, One people, One family, that of the children of Our Father.

Philippe
