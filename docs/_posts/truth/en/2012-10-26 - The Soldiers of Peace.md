The Soldiers of Peace exist in your Heart, their weapon is Love, their strength is The Light. They are engaged in a fierce battle against the Ego, and even if they lose the battles of this existence, they will eventually prevail.

Man has this force within him which, if not mastered and understood, can lead him towards the scourges of violence, war, and bloodshed. This force is there for a specific purpose: to make man a Knight of Love and The Light.

Peace will eventually settle in the hearts of men, and once established, they will feel the need to conquer the Hearts of their Brothers and Sisters. They will set out to fulfill the Will of Our Father and bring The Kingdom to Earth. The "Our Father" is a prophecy, it clearly states what must be and will indeed be.

Lay down these weapons, guns, and other hideous inventions because they serve no purpose. They only drag you individually and collectively down a path of misery, in order to provoke a necessary awakening. There are other paths for humanity, simpler, more beautiful paths with less waste. Humanity has a choice, each individual through who they are, what they become, and what they do contributes to this choice. It is therefore a collective responsibility: that of humanity. We must act quickly, my Brothers, my Sisters, time is of the essence...
