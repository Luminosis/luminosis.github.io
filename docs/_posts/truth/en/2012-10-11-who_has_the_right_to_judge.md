Who are you, man, to judge your brother? Who are you, man, to punish, chastise, avenge, kill in the name of Our Father? What do you think will be your future and your path after committing the worst acts against Our Father and your brother? Do you not see the fear that you spread? This fear that drives women and men away from Our Father. This fear that leads Souls onto long paths where they then seek their Faith.

No man has the right to judge his brother or sister in the name of Our Father. Men may have their own laws but none can claim the divine right of Life and its sister Death.

Our Father is Love.

Philippe
