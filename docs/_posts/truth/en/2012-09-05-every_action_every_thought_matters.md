No man, no woman is alone on this Earth. Solitude is an illusion of the mind. An illusion vivid in those whose Heart has forgotten Our Father. Carl Jung stated the principle of Synchronicity. Alain Corneau developed this even further by leaning towards the idea that all men and women in this World are one. They are right. All men and women of this World are one, one family, one unity.

We all have the same Father and the same Mother. The Earth is our Mother, she is the matter of our bodies and of everything that exists here below. Our Father is Life, Love and Forgiveness, Intelligence and Wisdom. A man or a woman is the result of Love, of the Union, between Our Father and Our Mother. The principle of the feminine and the masculine is an unalterable Law of everything that exists in this World. So there is Our Father and Our Mother.

The women and men of this World are united by matter and united by the spiritual and the subtle. They are united by the feminine and the masculine that is within each of them. What each man or woman does, thinks, has an impact on all of humanity. Individualism without consequence does not exist. Certainly, each woman and man is free, however, they must understand that their thoughts and actions not only have an immediate impact on them and their lives, but also an impact on all of humanity. Do you understand better now the damage caused by the sum of your foolishness? Do you understand that violence, blood, religions, hatred, intolerance, anger, lies, weapons, etc., all lead you together towards a grim destiny?

Every gesture, every thought counts. Every Act of Love is a work for the happiness of humanity. Every prayer in the silence of the Heart lightens the fate of humanity. Love will eventually prevail because that is the Will of Our Father, and also of Our Mother. Humanity is free to choose Love now, or it will be another humanity that will do so. Another humanity for the Kingdom of Our Father to come on Earth as it is in Heaven.

Philippe
