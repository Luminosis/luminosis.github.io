The World is made this way, Truth must be reborn in the Hearts of men so that their minds can be liberated, and so that they can open the doors to a radiant future for Humanity. They have no choice, all the time spent in error is time wasted. The principles of this World will be reminded to them as many times as necessary until they understand. The wall is endless until the door of Light that only open eyes can see.

Men and women of this world, your behavior makes us constantly hit against this wall. We all suffer for nothing, solely due to our own blindness. It is time. It is high time that we open our eyes, for we risk hitting harder than usual. This happens regularly. A shock to bring us back to the consciousness of what we are. Forget who you are, and Our Father will remind you, in a thousand and one forms, from the most incongruous to the most subtle, so that your eyes open through your understanding.

Your Heart is your true brain. It is the one that must guide your steps. Do not let this World become a new blaze, on which Our Father will have to rebuild a new humanity. It is up to us, human beings, each of us, to open our Hearts and to subdue those of our brothers and sisters.

We have this power, let us arm our Hearts and go into battle. For it is a fight that is being prepared. A hand-to-hand combat with what this world contains of the most ferocious: fear, hatred, ignorance, and the demons that haunt the Hearts of men and women.

To me, my Brothers, my Sisters! The battle begins!

Philippe
