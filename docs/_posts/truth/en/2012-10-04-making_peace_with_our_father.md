To make Peace, both parties must want it. One to reach out and the other to accept and take it. Our Father's hand is extended - it always will be - towards mankind, and it is up to them to accept and take it. This World will only know Peace once men have understood this obvious truth.

Your prayers are useless if you do not start by making Peace with Our Father, and for that, start by abandoning religions, their rituals, and destructive madness. Simply come back, in the silence of your room, to Our Father. Understand that He is Love and that everything He puts in your path, He does out of Love for you. What happens to you, whether you judge it in the moment as good or bad, is only there to guide you towards Him. Open your Heart in this silence, listen, and pray. Faith is expressed in discretion and humility, those who turn it into a circus, a source of money or power are in the most serious error.

If you think your misfortunes are the work of Our Father then you have not understood.<br>
If you think that man can do as he pleases then you have not understood the Laws of this World and the Kingdom of Our Father.<br>
If you believe that you can think whatever you want in the secrecy of your brain then you have not understood that nothing is hidden from Our Father, that thoughts are simulations and that they do exist.<br>

To make Peace, accept that you are children of Our Father, that He is Love and that He is waiting for you as in the parable of Jesus of Nazareth, like a father waiting for the return of his prodigal son.

This World has already known Peace, certainly a precarious, short Peace but proof that when Humanity is led by Wise and Insightful men, it moves forward peacefully under the happy gaze of Our Father.
