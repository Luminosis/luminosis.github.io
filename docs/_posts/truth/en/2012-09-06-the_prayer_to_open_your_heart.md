Prayer, a thing of the past, isn't it? A tool good for a few mystics and religious fanatics. Well no, Prayer is what you need as spiritual nourishment. Prayer is the act that every man and woman must perform to open their Heart and set themselves on the path. Oh it is not necessary to go to a place of religion, on the contrary choose a tree, a garden, a quiet place that suits you.

Do not confuse Prayer and religion because these are two completely different things. Prayer is part of Nature and therefore of man. Religions are a hideous invention of men in order to enslave other men and to instrumentalize them. Forget religions, forget their rituals all more absurd than the others and come back to Our Father by the sheer force of prayer.

Do not pray mechanically, no, pray with your Heart, with your thoughts, with your Joy and everything that makes you a Son or Daughter of Our Father.
Do not confuse the will of Our Father and yours, because only the will of Our Father will be. Use your prayers to understand what Our Father wants for you and what he expects from you.

You can pray for a few minutes or hours, it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is the Heart and sincerity you put into it.

Learn to thank Our Father for what is given to you, because everything Our Father puts on your path he does out of Love, out of Love for you. Our Father is Love and his Will can only proceed from Love.
