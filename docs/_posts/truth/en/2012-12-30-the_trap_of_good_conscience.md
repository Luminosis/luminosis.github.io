Good conscience is a formidable danger, the trap of the ego that likes to think of itself as goodness and kindness. Oh, it is not enough to say "yes" to everything and nothing, to indulge in displayed goodness to understand what Love is. On the contrary, many of the most formidable egos hide behind "good consciences" of convenience.

Love is knowing how to say, do, accomplish what is Right. Love is unconditional, it has no fear and therefore accomplishing what is Right follows. Our Father gives each of us every day what is necessary for us to move forward on our path. He gives it with Love. There is no good or bad, only what is necessary for each of us.

Love is therefore the force that allows us to accomplish what is Right and Good, and there is nothing more difficult. It is necessary to completely surrender to Love, with all one's being, to give oneself. But giving oneself is not accepting everything, it is not saying "yes" to everything, it is not acting according to what others will say or think, no, giving oneself to Love is doing, saying, thinking, feeling what is Right and Good.

Do not just build a "good conscience" because there is nothing more selfish. Too many people boast their ego with this "good conscience". Return to Love, to the unconditional and the surrender to Love because it is within its bosom that you will find what is Right and Good.
