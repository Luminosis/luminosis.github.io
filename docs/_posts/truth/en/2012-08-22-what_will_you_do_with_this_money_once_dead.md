Money, what a beautiful invention! It is useful for trading and exchanging, but when this object, this little useful thing, becomes your God then all is lost; reason leaves you; humility disappears. Intelligence fades to make way for greed, hatred, jealousy, anger and everything that feeds the Shadow.

You tell me? Religions have money. Some even have banks. This is not surprising, they who only run after power over the hearts of men so that they may massacre each other under the laughter of the demons who hold their priests.
What will you do with this money once you are dead? It has no use or value in Heaven. It will not serve you to redeem yourself.

So why do you chase after money when Faith in Our Father will bring you everything and even your dreams? Is money not ridiculous compared to that? Is capitalism not a vile invention of man to divert him from his own path and lead him far, very far from Love, Peace and Joy.

Think. What do you want? A lot, a lot of money that you will not be able to spend during your only existence in the heavy material world or everything you have dreamed of and more? Is the choice so difficult? To believe in Our Father or like a donkey follow the carrot of money?
