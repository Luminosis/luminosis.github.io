To know and to be. To be and to know. You will be and you will know. In meaning, to be and to know are identical. If you are not what you know then you are nothing or so little, because what you are depends on what you know, and what you will learn - or not - will determine your future.

So what do you know? You know how to destroy, massacre, dirty, trample, stain, kill, burn, annihilate, pollute, lie, and therefore you are that. Here is a sad humanity: a hideous beast. You will not change anything about what your future should be if you do not change, if you do not radically evolve what you know and do not align with it.

Why is Our Father Love? What does He know that allows Him to be Love? What does He know that you do not know? And yet you know that Our Father made man in His image, so what have you forgotten or not learned?

Open your eyes! Look. Reflect. What Our Father has given you is an invaluable gift. You have a wealth without end in front of which your money is only trinkets.

The Knowledge you must acquire is there, right in front of you. Open your eyes! Learn and you will finally be able to change your future.
