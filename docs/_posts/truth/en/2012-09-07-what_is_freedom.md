What is Freedom? What do you believe about Freedom? Is it the right to do anything and everything? Is it the right to kill, to rape, to carry weapons, to annihilate species, to burn forests to the last tree? Is that the definition of Freedom? Freedom as a right and excuse to do as you please, spread evil, shed blood, incite hatred, provoke violence and intolerance, generate jealousy, etc.? Oh how beautiful this Freedom is! There are executioners happier than men who think that Freedom is like this.

Man and woman are free and equal. There is absolutely no difference between woman and man for Our Father. None. Both are therefore free, but free within the limits of the Laws of Our Father and in fact the Laws of the Universe, of Nature, of Love and Forgiveness.

The Soul can wander in time and space, in the infinity allowed by the Laws of Our Father. Not beyond because beyond there is nothing, nothing but nothingness. Freedom allows this greatness of what is understood by the strength and power of intelligence and reasoning. That is why Freedom.

Humanity is free to learn and succeed or to squander and perish. The choice is in your hands...

Philippe
