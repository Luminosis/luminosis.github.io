Who will understand? Who will open their eyes? Who will have a Heart that trembles? Who will love their neighbor? Who will open their Heart to Love? Who? Who? You? Him? Her? Who?

What do you hope for if you do nothing? What do you believe? Do you think Our Father will let you destroy, ruin, and dirty everything? Do you think your money will allow you to buy your Forgiveness at the hour of your death? Men and women of little Faith!

Do you think you are alone? Do you really believe that there is "nothing" after Death? Your logic defies understanding. Nature shows you the opposite. Everything is in front of you but you prefer to drink the ease and eat the black bread of Shadow and Religions.

How do you expect to know Love, Peace, Joy, and everything that comes with it? Come back to Our Father! Forget the Religions because they are harmful and dangerous for humanity. Sincerely return to the Silence of your Heart to Our Father and ask for Forgiveness. Help make this World a Paradise on Earth. It is possible! Our Father only wishes for that! Pray, act, and it will be!

Philippe
