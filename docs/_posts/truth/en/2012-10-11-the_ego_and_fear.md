What shadow is veiling your Heart today? What fear have you formed in the solitude of your brain? What door have you double-locked so that your Heart and Soul cannot cross the threshold?

The Ego has the property of Fear. It is afraid of not being anymore. It knows it is fictitious, an illusion, but it does not want to admit it. The Ego is a variable set of thoughts and memories. It only loves the past and the future. The present, the present moment, scares it more than anything.

Mastering your thoughts, feelings, and emotions is the basis of everything. This is the first work you must undertake. Without this, you will never be the master of your Life but the horrified observer watching an Ego wreak havoc, tarnish, and devastate..

The Ego is like a computer program, an artificial intelligence. Simply press the switch and it stops. The switch is your Intelligence, your reason, and that Heart that shows you the way to follow. Nothing is easy, otherwise what value would it have? What lesson and benefit would you derive from it? So, yes, it is an effort, an exercise of Will, but this is how Wisdom is acquired. It will not come by slouching in front of a television. No. Turn it all off, enjoy the silence, and listen to yourself. Learn to distinguish between what is "you" and this Ego.

The path is narrow and the gate is tight that leads to Our Father, and one must have let go of what must be let go to gain access.
