What do you need to live in Peace, Joy, and Love? What should you manufacture in your factories? What should humanity invent? What economic and political model?

Nothing. Humanity has nothing to invent, nothing to produce, nothing to establish, nothing. Nothing because everything is already there. Opening your eyes and your Hearts, that is the only thing you need to do.

The Love of Our Father constantly floods this World. All men and women are loved equally. Happiness is there. Peace is there. Love is there. Joy is there.

The day humanity stops to contemplate this World and return to Our Father, then everything will appear.

Philippe
