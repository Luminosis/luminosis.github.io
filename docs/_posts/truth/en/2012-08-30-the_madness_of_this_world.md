Man who are you to say that Our Father is an outdated invention and that it is time to burn the Bible? What have you learned from the history of humanity? In the last twenty years and since the Internet, is there now no longer a need for Faith?

Have you counted the number of deaths and measured the oceans of blood that have flowed in the last 2012 years? Have you counted how many times men have killed other men in the last 2012 years? Reflect, look and contemplate because these corpses, these oceans of blood are your legacy. This is essentially what you have done with these 2012 years. Cry and understand.

Who will come to save you from this madness? Who will show you the price of what you have done? Who? Look into your Heart. There is a deep anxiety, a fear, you know somewhere deep down that you will have to answer for your actions and so will all of humanity.

You have little time left to realize the madness that has taken hold of this World. What you call "normal": war, violence, hatred, weapons, blood, etc., is only horror. Act. Act, quickly...
