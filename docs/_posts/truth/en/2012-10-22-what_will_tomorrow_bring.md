What will tomorrow be? Tomorrow will be made up of the consequences of what you did yesterday and will give you the opportunity to understand your mistakes and foolishness in order to go back to the starting point and correct them. Day after day, the accumulation of mistakes and foolishness becomes less those that are corrected. The Law of Causality is simple but unforgiving.

Can we correct everything quickly? Yes, it's called a Miracle and simply requires letting the Love of Our Father be within you, letting the voice of the Holy Spirit guide you. On a global scale and after more than two thousand years of foolishness, it takes the strength and power of a very large number of Sons and Daughters of Our Father to achieve such a Miracle. Is it impossible? No, everything is always possible, man is free and therefore everything is possible for him, but he is not alone. The Earth and Nature are also free.
