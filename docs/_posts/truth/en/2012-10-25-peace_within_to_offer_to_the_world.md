Peace is what every woman and man must discover within themselves. Where Peace resides is where Our Father is, because Peace is the state of the Kingdom. Peace is not obtained by fighting or taming external elements, no, Peace is obtained within oneself. It is the result of personal work.

Peace is possible for everyone, and once found, it will never leave you. Peace is a stable and invulnerable state.

But where to start to find it? You do not find it, you gradually gain it through working on your thoughts, feelings, and desires. You must know how to clean your inner house and keep it clean to hear the Silence of Peace. You must know how to keep your Body in a state of fitness and good health because without that, Nature will remind you, disturb your journey towards Peace, until you have done what is necessary.

War never brings Peace. War only prepares for war, only the Peace of each person united with that of their Brother and Sister generates Peace outside of them.

You must clean up to return to the foundation of a healthy mind in a healthy body, but that does not mean deprivation, humiliation, and asceticism! On the contrary, eat and drink, but only what is good for your Body and Soul. Good and excellent food is essential. So yes, you will have to replace what is harmful like cigarettes, coke, and other junk with pleasures that are good for your Body. Do not believe that these harmful products and the monsters who sell them are innocent...

Finding Peace requires finding Willpower, and this will lead you to other virtues like Wisdom. It depends only on you, and no one else, to set yourself on the path towards Peace and thus offer it to this World.
