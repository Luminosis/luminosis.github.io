Put a man on a boat and have him sail around the Oceans. Put a man on top of a tree and let him contemplate Nature. These two men will discover what your eyes no longer see. Someone has put their hands in front of your eyes, and they make sure that you no longer see the World or Nature.

You should read or reread "The Long Way" by Bernard Moitessier, his journey is the story of a man who becomes a Son of Our Father. Oh, he doesn't talk about religion, or so little that it's insignificant. He talks about a man who discovers the World, a white schooner that brings him the news, the sign of Jonah, an inner struggle, an understanding that is achieved, an alchemy. It's a magnificent testimony.

This someone who puts their hands in front of your eyes is society, this thing that humanity has created. Moitessier calls it "The Monster" and he is right because this hideous beast, nurtured within religions for 2012 years, is leading you straight towards the abyss. Never let anyone or anything put their hands in front of your eyes, neither religion, nor society, nor man, because that's how one gets lost.

Open your eyes, remove those hands from in front of your eyes, come back to Our Father, and who knows - maybe a white schooner will come and land on your knee.
