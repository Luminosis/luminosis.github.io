What do you know about the Will of Our Father? Have you taken a moment to reflect on what His Will could be? What is His will for you, His will for the World?

Those who recite the Our Father without thinking about its meaning have forgotten to contemplate these words "Thy will be done". What do these words mean? Why did Jesus of Nazareth include these words in the Our Father? What is this Will then? Where does it come from? What does it seek?

There is an anxiety that arises, for how can you live without knowing what the Will of Our Father is? And if you knew deep down what the Will of Our Father is but did not do the work to fulfill it?

Our Father is merciful and compassionate, that is the strength of His Love, and from His Forgiveness comes justice and patience. But... yes: but. But if your actions cause the Will of Our Father to no longer be on the path then He will act to set things right. Man and woman are free; free to choose the path that leads to fulfilling the Will of Our Father. They can only choose that, because the rest, the Will of Our Father is the Law of the Universe.

Philippe
