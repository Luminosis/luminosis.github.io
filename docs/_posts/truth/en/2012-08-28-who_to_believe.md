Who to believe? This is a big question for humanity. You can read all my writings and laugh until you cry, mock me like in a schoolyard, call me crazy, etc. Fine, but show me what in what I have written can be refuted by reasoning and a global counter-model?

Blood, war, violence, pollution, hatred, religions, Nature, the Body, Metaphysics, Life, Love, etc., what other model or complete philosophy do you have to oppose me?
Oh, your sacred principle of only matter as the sole reality. Well, yes, it is Nature, Metaphysics, atoms, the Body and everything else. So you see that all of this, on the contrary, fits very well into the model and philosophy that I present to you.

Oh yes, you will say that the Church is missing and call me "mystical". Religions are nonsense, an atheist in this World is surely closer to Our Father than many men and women who claim to be fervent practitioners of a religion. Look at Michel Onfray, a fine example of intelligence and reasoning. In the end, he knows more about this World than an army of erudite theologians.

"And the Bible," you will say. "You quote the Bible so you are religious, mystical and therefore crazy." First of all, since when has reading the Bible become the sole act of a madman? Quickly, go lock up the clergy and all the Christians in this World! Hurry up! Secondly, the Bible is not a religious book. Religions - which are horrible inventions of men - have used, violated and distorted the Bible for their own interest and power. The Bible is a work of Philosophy, just as much as the magnificent volume "The Epicureans" from the Pleiades. A philosophy with principles of Life, principles to understand the World and life, a morality, etc. But go listen to Michel Onfray because he explains all this much better than me.

So what complete counter-philosophy do you have to oppose? Think. Look at the World. Look at yourself and think.

Philippe
