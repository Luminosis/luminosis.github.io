Have you encountered Love on your path? Did time stand still while simulacra flew between the two of you - her and him?

Our Father is Love and he made man in his image, so man also is made of Love. Love is in each of the men and women of this World. It is there within reach of your thoughts, emotions, and feelings. If you seek it outside of yourself, if you think you need something or someone to access Love, it is because you have not yet realized that you are a child of Our Father.

Religions play with this by forcing their followers to perform crazy acts under the pretext that this way they will access paradise. You must not have read the divine texts - the only divine texts not those of the fools of religions - to believe such nonsense. All men, without exception, will access Heaven because they are already there! Their mission is to bring about the Kingdom of Our Father on Earth and thus create union between Heaven and Earth. The Will of Our Father is that men work to return to him through matter and thus transform this World into a Kingdom of Our Father.

Love is here, in unlimited quantity, available to all. You just have to open your eyes, leave these religions and their madness to their misery, and get to work. Humanity will eventually fulfill the Will of Our Father, that is not the question, the question is which humanity? This one or another?
