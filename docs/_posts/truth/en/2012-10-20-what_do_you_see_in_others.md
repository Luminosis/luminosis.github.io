What do you see in others? Do you see an enemy? An unbeliever? Do you see a life without value? Do you see a body to possess through sex? Do you see ugliness? What do you see?

Our Father only sees what He has created, and He created it in His image. He sees Love. He sees His Son or His Daughter, nothing else because there is nothing else.

Men's Ego has invented many horrors to separate men, differentiate them, and ultimately sow hatred, anger, and war. Egos have invented religions to satisfy a thirst for power and domination. Religions: men who think they can rule through their Ego in the name of Our Father.

Look at your brother, look at your sister and reflect because the way you look at them tells you who you think you are. Seek Love to become "Who you are".
