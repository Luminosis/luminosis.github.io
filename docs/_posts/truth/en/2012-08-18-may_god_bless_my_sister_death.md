Death. You talk a lot about Life. Does it have a meaning? What does it mean? What is it for? Why do we live? But have you ever truly understood what Death is?

Saint Francis of Assisi said "May God bless my sister Death." He was dying and finally understood. Death is part of Nature. There is no Nature without Death. Nothing regrows without death. The beauty of Birth alone should not overshadow the Rightness of Death.

Are you afraid of Death? You see your life slipping away before your eyes and Death scares you? What you don't understand is that Death will bring you back to Our Father, and there you will have to answer his questions. You will have to explain why you have done so many foolish things. Why you have not kept any of your commitments. Because, yes, you come to Earth with a very specific mission. This mission may be the simplest and shortest, sometimes you don't even have time to be born.

Understand well, the Mission of Humanity is to bring the Reign of Our Father on Earth. It is written in the "Our Father" that millions of women and men recite daily without even understanding that the Truth is there, right in front of their eyes!
<center><i>Thy kingdom come (on Earth as it is in heaven)â€¨<br> Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven</i></center>
<br>
That's as simple as that!

Where do you see weapons and blood in the Kingdom of Our Father? Are the Heavens an orgy of sex for sex and a permanent bloodbath where everyone carries as many revolvers and rifles as they can? What madness!

Our Father is Love!

Read again. Our Father is Love!

So put down these infernal machines, stop these wars that make no sense, and listen to the song of the bird that will come to rest beside you.

Philippe
