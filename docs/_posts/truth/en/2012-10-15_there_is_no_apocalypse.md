There is no Apocalypse, there are only corrections based on the mistakes and foolishness of men. There is no more Apocalypse than there is Hell. Our Father is Love and everything that comes from Him is Love.

The Body is mortal, the Soul is immortal. Time and space are the place of the Body. Eternity and Infinity are the place of the Soul. Man is the union of physical and subtle matters, and what will happen to this World, until the day it becomes the Kingdom of Our Father, is only the Will of Our Father adapted according to the path that humanity freely chooses.

The Last Judgment is not the end of the World. No, it is the advent of the Kingdom of Our Father on Earth. It is the end of time because time will then be useless.

On the path that humanity has taken, there are several lessons and one of them is that Nature is inviolable by men. Humanity must learn to respect and Love Nature because without it there would be no humanity.

Should we be afraid of tomorrow? No, because tomorrow, like today, is filled with the Love of Our Father. Yes, because the lesson of tomorrow is full of the consequences of the foolishness and mistakes made yesterday, and no, because humanity can act, at any moment, and choose another path.

Humanity can correct its mistake and undertake to change paths, but it must do so quickly, very quickly.

Philippe
