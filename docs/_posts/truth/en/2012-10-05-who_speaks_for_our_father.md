Who speaks for Our Father? Where are the unaltered and true texts? Are the books of religions reliable? Who to believe and what to read?

The basic principle is to appeal to your Intelligence and reasoning abilities. Never take anything at face value, not even what I write. Read and use your faculties of Intelligence and reasoning. Look at Nature because it is unaltered Truth and no religion can claim it. Abandon rituals and temples, meditate and pray in the silence of your room. It is only through your own work that you will begin to discern and understand.

Faith comes from Intelligence and reasoning abilities and nothing else. The writings, those that you will be able to identify - through Intelligence and reflection - can help you, save you time, give you clues.

The books of religions have all been abused, transformed and manipulated excessively, when they have not simply been invented from scratch! Some still contain readable and useful passages. The life of Jesus of Nazareth is probably the cleanest things to this day. And even then, all the nonsense and modifications made for the sole interests of the Vatican should be removed. Many apocryphal texts should be added, which are often much cleaner than those of the official Bible.

How to know? Meditate, reflect and pray, that is the only method. Through self-work, Truth will come to you and you will be able to sort things out. Start by working on the assertion that Our Father is Love...
