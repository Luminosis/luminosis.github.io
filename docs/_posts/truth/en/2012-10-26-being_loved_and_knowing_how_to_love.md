To be Loved, one must first know how to Love.

To feel Love, one must open their heart, feel the need for the gift of Love.

Those who open their hearts find the path to the Love of Our Father. This Love rushes in and takes back its rightful place, and the light is there.

Open your Hearts. Learn to lLve.

Philippe
