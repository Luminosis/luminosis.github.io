What is Wisdom? Where does it come from? How can it be acquired? Is it possible to receive it? Is Wisdom the daughter of Intelligence or is it the other way around?

Wisdom is what is born through learning life's lessons when one uses their Intelligence and reasoning faculties. Wisdom is what will allow the Daughters and Sons of Our Father to rebuild Our Father's Israel.

Wisdom is acquired through continuous and perpetual work. There is no end to this work. Wisdom is the fruit of good and bad, as one must be confronted with both to move forward and progress. If you do not recognize every event in your life as a lesson of Wisdom, then you will remain ignorant.

Good and bad turn the wheel of Wisdom. What is bad for one is good for another. No man without woman, no night without day, no good without bad. Both are necessary for the evolution of Humanity, but do not confuse bad with Shadow. Shadow is the fruit of the foolishness of men, while good and bad come from Our Father. You confuse bad and this Shadow that spreads over this World due to your madness and the scourge that are religions. Bad is nothing, it is only the obstacle you must overcome, the work you must do on yourself, the hurdle you must pass in order to move towards Wisdom. Good is also a test because it requires an even greater effort to become Wisdom. How many men have understood the test that is the wealth of money? Very few! The poor learn more and faster.

Remember Our Father is Love and everything He does comes from this Love. Remember that Birth and Death are Sisters, daughters of Nature, and they only represent the passage from one state of consciousness to another. Good and bad are only lessons from the book of Wisdom.
