The World. Open your eyes to the World. How many times have I already said it. If you do not know how to see the World then you will never know anything. To be. Do you know how to Be? You think you are because you have something: a house, a car, an iPad, etc., but in truth you are nothing or more precisely you are still just a body with a brain. You do not know who you are. Pindar rightly said: "Become what you are". So do you know what you are?

A vast question and yet the answer is the simplest. You are Sons and Daughters of Our Father. Nothing more and nothing less. That is what you are, but you do not want to become it because you do not listen to yourself. Your brain produces a deafening noise under the baton of your Ego.

Let go of your Ego, just a little bit and you will discover... the Truth... of what you are.
