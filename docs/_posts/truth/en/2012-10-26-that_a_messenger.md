All of this may seem absurd, crazy, laughable to the extreme, etc., however read it correctly and completely and you will see a logic and consistency in it. There is nothing extraordinary about what I write and many have already said it through the ages. I am just another messenger, nothing more. I am not important, only the one who guides my hand is important.

Laugh if you want, I can't do anything about it and it must be so for you today, but remember what you have read because one day you will understand.
