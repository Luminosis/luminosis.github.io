Your body is a fabulous tool. An instrument that you must take care of and get to know. Why? Because it is with it that you will travel your path towards Our Father. The Church and religions, by denying the Body, have once again caused deep damage. Religions are plagues, and it is high time that humanity gets rid of them as soon as possible.

Respect your Body. Your Body is a part of Nature that is entrusted to you. It is up to you to manage, administer, protect, care for, and cultivate this piece of Nature. So understand that what you drink and eat is of cardinal importance. This does not mean abstinence or denial of pleasures, quite the contrary! You must enter the realm of Love for what you eat and drink. A meal prepared with Love and from products that have known the Love of those who cultivated them will have a flavor and nutritional capacity unmatched!

You can ingest as much as you want of these foods that have known nothing but cold mechanics or worse, the violence of an unworthy death, you will never be nourished. At best, you will survive, and at worst, you will turn your Body into a garbage dump.

Humanity must come back to reason. Nature can feed it a thousand times a day and endlessly, but it will only do so if humanity begins by opening its eyes...
