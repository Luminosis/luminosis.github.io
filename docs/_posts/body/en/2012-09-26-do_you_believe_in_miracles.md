Do you believe in Miracles? Do you believe in what the Bible says about Jesus of Nazareth? Do you believe that the Soul can act on the Body? Do you believe that it is possible to heal all the Diseases of the Body?

The Body is just a Body, a place where the Soul settles for a limited time. This Body is an instrument, a means, for the Soul to confront matter. Like any instrument, it must be taken care of and enjoyed. This Body is initially the instrument that Nature gives, it contains what is necessary and all that you may call defects are actually essential. It is up to you to understand through what is given to you the meaning of your path. Chance does not exist and the principle of causality is universal and integral.

The Disease may already be in your body or may appear as you refuse to understand, as you distrust what must be. Disease is a message. A strong message that you cannot ignore. The faster the message needs to be heard, the stronger or more powerful the disease is.

So what is a Miracle? A Miracle is simply understanding the message, returning to Our Father and entering into Forgiveness, atoning for past mistakes. What no longer needs to be disappears then. When the Disease no longer has a reason to exist because the message is understood, Faith is restored and atonement is made, then it departs.

The Miracle is not miraculous at all, it is just a gesture that a Son of Our Father makes to help his neighbor understand and progress on his path. The healing of the World is possible, it just requires that the men and women of this World make the effort...
