Do you know why your Heart contracts and expands to circulate blood? It's a muscle with nerves, you might say. Well, that explains the how, the mechanics, but not the why. Why does it sometimes stop like that too? You know, "his heart stopped beating".

The Heart. What could make a Heart beat? Muscle? Nerves? Brain? A purely mechanical system? Where is the natural battery then? Look as you might, you won't find it because you are missing an essential element: Love and Forgiveness. Yes! Love and Forgiveness.

Love is expansion, it's the blood flowing through the veins and nourishing the Body. Forgiveness is contraction, purification, taking back what is tainted so that it becomes Love again and can be given once more.

"Nonsense!" you might say. Very well. Let it be given to you: nonsense and ignorance on top of that. The World operates on the principle of Love and Forgiveness. If you ignore this principle, you will know nothing, learn nothing, and your eyes will eventually cry on the day you realize your mistake.
