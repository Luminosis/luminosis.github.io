Tears. Have you ever thought about what a tear is? Why do we cry? What is the purpose of it?
The mechanics of the body that make a man or a woman cry are known to you. But do you know what it means to cry from laughter or cry from sadness?

Tears are a way of giving Forgiveness and Love. Yes, tears are an essential catharsis for every man or woman to prevent them from one day falling into madness. Those who never cry have lost the way to their heart. They are shadows and plagues.

A tear is the water of Forgiveness. It is pure. It comes from the eyes. It flows on the face like a caress and dries in the sun. A tear is not sad, no, it is Love. It is what transforms an emotion or a fear into Love and Forgiveness. So yes, you must cry and not hold back your tears. Let them flow, let them be. Every time you hold them back, it is a suffering that you inflict on your body and it will remember it for you.

So cry, but do not play with tears. Some know how to provoke tears, play the drama of tears, they are beings who must understand that they need to stop that and return to Our Father. Do not play with the tears of your Body because they come from the Heart, and if you do not pay attention, your Body will find a disease to make you understand.
