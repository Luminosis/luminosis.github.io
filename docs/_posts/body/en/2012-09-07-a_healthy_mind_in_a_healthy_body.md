*'A healthy mind in a healthy body'* is an adage full of wisdom that shows how much our distant ancestors had acquired knowledge that is still lacking in this so-called modernity. Modernity is an illusion, a baseless stupidity, a monstrous flaw in intelligence and reasoning. There is nothing modern about having wasted thousands of years just shedding blood and sowing the Earth with all the most horrible plagues. Those who do not understand the value of past teachings have invented Modernity to try to camouflage their stupidity and ignorance.

In short, a mind in a body and both must be healthy - not to mention Holy. Juvenal said, *'one must know how to pray in order to obtain a healthy mind in a healthy body'*. The ancient Greeks spoke of Kalos Kagathos or *'good and in good shape'*.

The two come together. The Body is the matter - Our Mother. The Soul is Our Father. The union of the two when they are healthy - sanctified - gives rise to the rebirth of a man or woman into a Son or Daughter of Our Father and Our Mother. That is the work of humanity.

Long ago, man knew that this was what he had to do. Some in India and elsewhere still know it and apply themselves fervently, but the vast majority have forgotten. Why do you think international hydrae deploy so much force to continue promoting everything that dirties and darkens the bodies of men? What forces drive them? "Here comes another promoter of the global conspiracy!" you will laugh. "We smoke and drink whatever we want!" you will shout. Fine. Pollute your Bodies as you pollute the World. Massacre yourselves as you decimate the bees. Just know that Disease will come to remind you that the Body is Sacred and that you have committed a huge stupidity. Oh, you will try to heal yourselves, but what's the point? Disease will remain in many forms until you understand the message in this life or the next.
