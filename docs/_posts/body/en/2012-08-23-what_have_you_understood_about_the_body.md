The Body. What have you understood about your body and that of animals? What do you really know? You have a basic understanding of the mechanics of bones and structure but the essential escapes you.

The mass of water and its power are completely foreign to you. And yet it is the majority of the mass of the human body! So you are unaware of the strength and power of the majority of the body's mass...what can you do and heal?

Your medications are sometimes good remedies but you have not understood why or how. You grope in the dark pretending to be knowledgeable. Do you even know why the body reacts to the signal of one medication and not another? No, you do not know, but that does not stop you from producing and consuming anything in mass.

Professor Jacques Benveniste put you on the right track but you burned him at the stake of the Inquisition in the name of Science! Poor humanity, you finally had a true genius and you massacred, reviled, and annihilated him!

Look at yourself. Why do you breathe? Go ahead, explain to me why you breathe. You know "how" you breathe but do you know why you breathe? What triggers breathing? Why do you breathe automatically without thinking? Magic perhaps? No, something delicate and subtle is within you but you have no idea what it is...
