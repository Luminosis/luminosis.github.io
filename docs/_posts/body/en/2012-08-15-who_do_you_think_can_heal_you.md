You are in pain, you are suffering, the medications of men dull you and you are heading straight towards death. You don't know why. You don't know how to heal yourself. An existence lost due to the foolishness, ignorance, and vanity of a medical profession without Faith.

Who do you believe can heal you? You. Yourself. Certainly, for the injuries that men inflict upon themselves, human medicine is a magnificent tool and will continue to progress because it is essential. But for the illnesses that make your body try to convey a message to your Spirit, there is no salvation in medicine. At most, there is palliative care to make you fall asleep faster before reuniting with Our Father.

There is a way to heal everything, but not everything should be healed because what is meant to be for a man or a woman must be. Read and reread the Acts of Peter (Nag Hammadi Library). Peter can heal his daughter, he proves it but does not do it because his daughter's illness is part of her life and her path. She must understand on her own what this illness is telling her. She and she alone can heal herself.

So you who are suffering, you who implore Our Father to deliver you from your illnesses, meditate and reflect. Because nothing in this world is a result of chance. Every hair on your head is counted. Heal, open your eyes, your ears, and your Heart. It is at this price that you will regain your faculties in this life or the next. But if you close your Heart, your eyes, and your ears, then too bad, you will die with your illness and you will have to understand as you continue your path. The misery of this World has a meaning and an origin. Open your eyes and your Hearts. And if the Earth must be plunged into the deepest poverty and misery for humanity to awaken, then so be it.
