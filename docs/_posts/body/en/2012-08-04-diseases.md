Illness is a state of our Body, but this state is a reflection of who we are deep down. Certainly, we can fall, injure ourselves accidentally, simply from ourselves, because we humans are free and we have the choice in the paths we take, and the roads we travel on. But what is within us, or what is not, we can only heal or bring it by listening very carefully to our Body.

Anyone who forgets this rule for a moment will end up paying the price. And the price is illness. Illness is always a message. An accident, an injury is always a human error, and the cost of Freedom. Whoever forgets to listen to their Body, forgets who they are and will end up with the pains and afflictions that correspond to them. Michel Odoul has described this very well in his works. And it is time to reread them and circulate these teachings so that the most serious illnesses that humanity knows find a definitive remedy.

The relentless use of medication will never result in anything but new, even harder and more difficult illnesses. As long as we refuse to understand what an illness is, it will come back, again and again until death occurs or until the Heart is reborn through opening our eyes to the causes of this illness.
